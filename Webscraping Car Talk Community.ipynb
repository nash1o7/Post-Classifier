Take it out and drive at highway speeds.  You need to get it well circulated throughout the entire cooling system.', 'As noted it might work, on the other hand it may clog some passages.I’ll try that, thanks! We’ll see if it works.It might just be one leak, and then as you drive the air movement sprays it all over. Before you add the stop leak, get the engine up to temperature and pop the hood. See if you can see steam and if so, where it’s coming from. It would be a shame to potentially gunk up passages with stop leak if you only needed to replace a heater hose.I agree with shadowfax. This product is a last-ditch attempt to be used only when a proper fix can’t be done for some reason.Can you see the leaks?  Do you suspect that it could be the head gasket?  If you think it is the head gasket, I would suggest that you use the Subaru cooling system conditioner.  I’ve used it but it only works if the leak is very small.  It does not clog passages but I don’t know if it will work on leaks other than head gaskets.Stopleaks work quite well on radiator tube punctures,not on radiator seam, rubber hose or gasket leaks.Alright, I’ll have a thorough look at everything when’re engine is up to temperature.

In the instructions on the coolant bottle it says after adding coolant you have to run the car with the overflow reservoir cap off and the heat blasting at full until the car reaches normal operating temperature to remove bubbles from the coolant system. This prevents later overheating. My friend said I don’t need to do this unless I open the coolant system up. What’s the verdict? Is it necessary or unnecessary when just adding coolant to the system?

If it does show on another car than the OBD port on your Sentra may be at fault, bad connection, broken pin, etc. Unless, of course, it’s a thing on this model. I like to see a STFT of less than 5. More begins to be problematic but you still should be showing some value other than zero for LTFT. Hope some of this long winded reply helps.Hi Neburex,', 'It does, alot thanks. The scanner automatically sets the correct settings for the car. I was wondering why LTFT is reading 0, and I thought that wasn’t normal. I’ll look more into diagnosing the scanner or finding out about this specific model of Sentra.Ltft is a universal PID for all cars. There is a group of universal PIDs and a set of vehicle specific PIDs. Compare another reader.Sorry but I have to ask, what does PID stand for?Parameter ID. Basically an identifier of the OBD thing you are trying to read.Thanks Mustangman. I also contacted the manufacturer of the scanner, and they said that LTFT should be fluctuating. I’m going to try another scanner today.When you installed the new header, you had to move both O2 sensors downstream.  Usually the sensor 1 is mounted where the sensor two was mounted and sensor two requires a new bung installed after the cat.  You have eliminated the warm up cat, assuming that you used the NISMO header.', 'That will throw off your sensor 1 STFT.  Add to that that the connector for the sensor is in a bad place and tends to get full of water and has to be frequently dried out or you get bad readings.  You also have to make an extension harness for sensor 2.Hi Keith,', 'I have the 2J Street Spec Spyder header. I did verify with the manufacturer of the header the correct placement for the oxygen sensor 1 (top bung). I just left O2 sensor 2 alone - I was told readings from 02 sensor 2 do not affect engine performance (I do not currently have any engine codes)?', 'Thank you']\n",

CVT transmission keeps engine RPMs somewhat constant so speed is not a direct correlation. I’m guessing it has a relationship to the electrical drive system or hybrid battery charging. Local dealer had no clue, other than to suggest the alternator.I think you’re on the right track. Something in the electric motor is causing static and it may even be an indication the motor is about to fail. Both times the alternator failed in my Corolla there was a noise in the radio. Find a good independent shop that knows hybrids or another Toyota dealer.Controlling the speed of the vehicle may involve pulse modulation techniques. Waveform pulses can generate all kinds of interference to other things. I would think that the engineers have designed proper filtering into the design to eliminate interference issues. The first thing to check is the antenna ground to make sure it is bonded to ground well. A faulty antenna ground will let noise like this get into the signal. If that is okay then I would make sure the ground wire shielding of the vehicle is working okay.I would be curious to see if a portable radio in the car also had static. If not, you might have a radio problem.  If it does have static, then you might position the portable at different locations to see if you can discover a source.You said you do not get static when you are in Park.

In fact, at low speeds and in reverse it’s the vehicle’s main source of power. https://www.markville.com/how-hybrids-work/ After all, that’s how you get “regenerative braking.” Granted, it’s speculation on my part but I believe either the electric motor itself or something in the associated circuit is causing RF interference. When the vehicle is “in gear,” a circuit, a relay, something is energized whether the motor is running or not.It’s a hybrid - can’t rev it up it park. Throttle does nothing in park or neutral.I guess if I want to “rev” the system, I would need to put the car on jack stands.  Then, the portable radio on AM might be used to find the source.Thanks.

Meaning, the pedal needs to be pressed roughly 10% down in order for the shaking to start, anything less and there is no shaking. For instance, just cruising with my foot lightly on the pedal and maintaining the same speed results in no shaking. Likewise, slowing down using the brakes produces no shaking.', 'The shaking is not felt as much in the steering wheel as compared to the floor and seats where it is quite prominent.', 'When we first started experiencing the shaking, it was always typically on road trips at higher elevations. Road trips at lower elevations and we never experienced it. Until recently, it began to show itself at all elevations.', 'We can get the shaking to occur at speeds below 60mph, say 40mph but only if going uphill or if having been driving for an extended period of time. Cold start 40mph up hill results in no shaking. But highway driving 60mph + will for sure result in shaking, again only while accelerating not coasting or braking.', 'I have hooked up the BMW reader as well as a run of the mill OBD2 and found no codes.', 'Here are the repairs we have had conducted so far, since the onset of the shaking:', 'All wheels balanced and checked at tire shop', 'Front Flex Disc', 'Rear Flex Disc', 'Engine Mounts', 'Transmission (transfer case) Mount', 'Replace Front Differential Fluid', 'Replace Transmission Fluid', 'Other items that have been completed since the onset of shaking, but not due to the shaking (in case this helps narrow things down):', 'Oil and oil filter change', 'MAF sensor cleaned', 'Intake air filter changed', 'AC tensioner and belt, accessory tensioner and belt, idler pulley', 'Power steering fluid drain and refill', 'ICV cleaned', 'DISA cleaned and upgraded', 'Casual inspection of the front end shows nothing obvious. CV boots are intact with no rips or traces of grease leaking.', 'The last works completed on the car before the shaking begun were about a year prior to the onset of the shaking, we did fuel filter and spark plugs. But then we drove the car around 10 months with no issues until the shaking began.', 'In typical car talk fashion, I want to further confound things by throwing out there that we also have a very noticeable vibration at idle, in gear.

I will go under soon and check the crank pulley. I’d hate for this to be the issue, but it might in fact explain both of my problems possibly… I don’t think the front shaft has a u-joint, but the back one does and I will have a look this weekend.', 'The car has around 120k miles. I have not had a compression test, nor done a scan while driving, but I will add those suggestions to my list. The vacuum lines were also replaced about 3 years ago. No brake service has been done recently, the fluid was flushed about 2.5 years ago (around time for another flush soon I suppose).', 'Thank you for the excellent suggestions and for giving me more insight into what I need to keep troubleshooting!is there the possibility of an ignition miss / spark plug miss / coil misfire?  High speed / under load could be some kind of an ignition issue.   That would cause the engine to shake but only under those conditions.  Are you / have you been getting ANY check engine trouble codes at all?  (is the check engine light functioning?  does it light up at self-test when ignition is switched to ‘on’ before starting the car?).  Compression should be checked but I would think if compression is bad then this symptom would be present in the entire range of driving & acceleration.  Last thing - make sure all the spark plugs are tight and all the way in.  I’m not an expert but I mention these things as no one else has so far.  good luck.Another thought - you mention that this is an automatic transmission vehicle - is there the possibility of locking torque converter clutch malfunction or slippage?   Acceleration under load should cause the locking T.C. clutch to disengage.  If it doesn’t disengage that could force an ugly vibration under load.    Again, I’m not an expert and am not sure how your transmssion is set up.']\n",

It was burning a considerable amount of oil, so as an experiment, I put full synthetic 10W-30 in the crankcase.  It cut the oil consumption by at least 75% for more than two mowing seasons.  About the end of this season it began using oil and has become hard to start even with a new sparkplug.  I can tell that the compression is low.

At higher RPMs, it may only have 1/5000th of a second (200 microseconds) to build up, but in electrical time, thats a lot.', 'The current only flows through the primary of the coil which has fewer windings so it has less inductance so current flow builds quicker.  As current builds up in the coil, magnetic lines of force build up around the coil.  It is the build up of these that causes the inductance.', 'Now when the engine needs a spark, the connection that started the current flow is opened.  When this happens, the magnetic field begins to collapse.  The collapsing field cuts across the windings of the coil and when a magnetic field moves around a conductor, current is induced to flow.  When the field collapses, it not only cuts across the primary windings, it also cuts across the secondary windings inducing current in those as well.', 'There are about 100 times as many secondary windings as there are primary windings.  That alone would cause the voltage induced to be 100 times greater than the applied voltage, but there is more.  There is also a time factor involved in that the field collapses many times faster (1.2 - 4 microseconds) than it builds up because of the extra resistance caused by the spark plug.  So not only does the voltage go from 12vdc to 1200 v pulse, it an rise as high as 40,000 volts.', 'The voltage is determined by Ohms Law.  I wont go into that but basically, the higher the resistance in the secondary circuit (coil + wire + plug), the higher the voltage.

      "['Yesterday my 1996 Mercedes C220 would not start. It cranked like crazy but would not fire. Some things I suspect contributed: The gas tank was below 1/4 full. It was cold … about 25F. The night before I had put 140 lb. of sand in the trunk just before driving it about 15 miles home and parking it. My theory was that because of the weight of the sand and the low gas level, gas was not able to get to the fuel pump. So this morning I was going to put in a couple gallons of gas from my garage gas can. When I opened the gas cap there was a serious whoosh of air into the tank; there had been a substantial vacuum inside the tank. I put the cap back on, without adding any gas (the sand was still in the trunk), and the car started right up. Here’s my question(s): 1) Did the sand contribute in any way to the problem?; 2) Did the low gas level contribute?; 3) Did the cold weather contribute?; 4) Do I have a mechanical problem I need to take care of? Thanks.To me, the fuel pump should be able to override a vacuum in your tank.', 'But in theory, a vacuum in your tank would fight the flow of fuel out of the tank. The sand is a red herring. The low gas level creates a larger vapor space in the tank. The cold weather also creates a vacuum as the volume of the vapor space does not contract much to compensate for the decreased temperature and you can create a lower pressure system this way, because if the volume remains constant, then a decrease in temperature directly causes a decrease in pressure. These two things combined created a vacuum space in your tank (as compared to the outside air).', 'I still question though whether this should be able to fight against a fuel pump. They are designed to start the car under these conditions.', 'Bad fuel pump? Partially clogged fuel system could contribute to this? Anyone else have thoughts?A bad gas cap will create a vacuum in your gas tank. The fuel pump will pump fuel until the vacuum overrides the pumping action of the fuel pump. Replace the gas cap.This is a clear sign of a problem in the EVAP system, specifically the charcoal canister.', 'Your gas tank needs to breath in, to allow air to displace the gas pumped out and when the gas contracts during cooling, and out, because the volume in the tank inceases (1) whenn you fill it, (2) when the gas warms up in the sun, and (3) when  the fuel is agitated as you drive (agitated fluid takes up more volume). In order to allow it to breath while still preventing hydrocarbon molecules from getting into the atmosphere, it breaths ina and out through an activated charcoal bed. The component that contains this is called the “carcoal canister”. The charcoal catches hydrocarbon molecules in air that’s escaping the tank, and when you start the car a solenoid-operated “purge valve” and allows the HC to be drawn into the engine’s intake system and burned.', 'If the vent line to the canister becomes blocked or kinked, or if the charcoal bed becomes saturated with gas, the tank will be unable to breath in. A vaciuum will form in the airspace and the vacuume will prevent the pump from being able to pump gas out. It also places excess stress on the pump and can cause premature pump failure.', 'I’ve attached an “exploded view” drawing of my owne system just to illustrate the typical system.

None of our other cars seemed to need a name, though.I think that cars are such an intricate part of our daily lives that we develop attachments to them.  I know I spend so much of my life in the car, that a lot of time, the name comes from an experience we have together.  Growing up, my mom and I’s car was named Leslie (96 Nissan Maxima).  Mom still has Leslie and we have a lot of memories with her.  The car I have right now is called Shrek (99 ML320 Mercedes) and that is because when the sun casts a shadow in front of the car when you drive, it looks like Shrek’s head.  Square with little rear-view mirror ears.  But its not a rule to name a car, but I don’t think its a bad idea.I’m a female (obviously) and have named two of my cars: the first, a Neon, Ignignokt (after the ATHF character) and the second, an Altima, Naobi.

Not every car should have a name, if the vehicle deserves a name it will suit the personality of the car.Cars are the closest thing to a living being created by man.  Cars are born, breath, consume, dispose and die.  By naming a vehicle you’re personifying nothing but metal and with that name the car is actually given some bit of a soul.  My first car was a '91 brown, wood paneling, dodge grand caravan, the family car passed down to the young ones and I remember naming it Warren Grizzly because Warren Sapp and Grizzly Bears are both big, brown and mean.  Unfortunately by naming this hunk of metal I gave it a life that inevitably would come to an end, which it did.  Whether it’s got a name it will die one day.  I think a name makes it interesting and gives us humans comfort but at the same time grief and sorrow when it’s time to see it leave.I have always named my cars because they seem to have personalities. There was “Greenie” the Willies sedan whose battery exploded one hot day on the Mojave desert due to internal and ambient heat (I had neglected to make sure there was battery fluid; was able to smoosh the pieces together and get home!), “Modine” the 1949 Plymouth who was a cream puff, etc, etc. My husband and I (he’s actually worse than me) also anthropormorphosize our animals.

She was a 1966 red Barracuda with a little 286 cu. in. V-8. That engine wouldn’t qualify her as a muscle car, though she would, and regularly did, 90 mph. I bought her in June, so I named her Gemini, quickly shortening it to Gem. Though that’s the only car given a name I always think of my cars as females.

Don’t know what these are actually going for though.The range is listed because used cars sellers have different expectations for price and the urgency of the sale.

Using a Chevrolet 350 engine as a baseline with a Sun VAT-28 or 45 a proper battery should be tested by throwing a momentary load of 550 amps then quickly dropping the load to 350 amps for 10 seconds. Then watch the actual amp draw and voltage drop while cranking the engine for 10 seconds with the ignition disabled.

It’s a design flaw that they’re not addressing. my 2014 Forester was driven the same way and it never died so it’s clearly not my driving habits to blame. My question was if anyone knew if the computer update would actually help the problem.It could related to your driving habits, actually.

The third new battery is one I had installed by AAA during State stay-at-home orders and Subaru of America readily reimbursed me for that cost.  So, i feel they are working earnestly to address my situation; can’t complain.  Just want the problem fixed!  Will post here when I know the outcome after having the car back for a few weeks.I promised an update pertaining to the dead battery problems i was having with my 2017 Subaru Forester.  It has been roughly 5 weeks since it was diagnosed and worked on by the Subaru Service Center I’ve been using.  The field engineer called in to guide the diagnosis reportedly said it was neither of the modules cited earlier.  Instead, he said it was in need of a software update required to increase the efficiency of the vehicle charging the battery.  So far, no issues.  I let it go undriven for about 3 days and it started.  Then 5 days and it started and finally 7 days and it started.  Hope it is actually fixed for the long-term.Good to hear, thanks for the update.  Gone are the days of ‘put in a new voltage regulator’, I guess…I had the same issue with my 2017 Forester, the battery died multiple times the first year i purchased the car (new) before finally bringing it to the dealer in Nov 2018. They replaced the battery with a more powerful one and until this week (Oct 2020) I had no issues. This week the battery died once again. My son was driving the car and when parked turned the car off but left the keys in the ignition as i was in the car waitingfor him. The doors were closed, lights all off and nothing plugged into the chargers. The roadside assistance guy that came out to charge the battery noted that even though it recharged, it needed replacing. He also said he carries batteries for Subarus because its a common problem and raised my awareness to a class action lawsuit from a similar issue with the outback. I took the car back to the dealer and they again replaced the battery and also updated the battery charging software. My understanding is that the software update will allow the alternator to kick on sooner than it normally does. I’m hopeful but a little skeptical if this will address my specific issue as we drive on the interstate regularly and throughout the summer have been on long interstate trips just about every weekend so the battery should be recharging regularly…and batteries should last 3 to 5 years. I’ll keep this thread posted if i run into any other issues.A second update.  After all the work done at the Subaru Service Center which I described in a previous post, to my frustration the problem remains.  When I didn’t drive the Forester for 7 days, it failed to start. I don’t have the energy or patience right now to go through the entire process again with Subaru of America or the Service Center at the dealership.  I bought a portable jump starter which supposedly holds 20 jumps worth of charge.  $98 that I should not have had to spend, but needed the confidence that I won’t be stranded if I, say, leave my vehicle parked somewhere (airport or train station) for “too many” days.  Meanwhile, to try to keep the battery charged, I’ll continue to drive (wasting my time) when I shouldn’t have to, put miles on the vehicle (reduce trade/resale value) needlessly, burn gas unnecessarily, increase my CO2 footprint unnecessarily and add to the likelihood of having an accident (implications for repair costs and insurance rate hikes).An Accident:  Not to mention someone getting harmed or worse when I’m driving merely to keep an adequate charge on the battery.']\n",

Thanks again.Ok guys lets get a couple of things in line. 1st never do any work on any vehicle maintenance process until you have ALL THE NEEDED SUPPLIES AT HAND!!! you should never run any auto 2 quarts low it causes inadequate oil circulation which causes a lack protection to the bearings and other things.like wearing out crank bearings quickly. So always make sure you have all the things you need to do the job BEFOTPRE you start the job. 2nd ALL vehicle manufacturers require that you presoak the new oil filter by filling it with oil and letting it sit for 10 min estimated so the filter can wik up the oil. After its done wikking the oil then install. This prevents the delay of oil distribution which causes damage to the engine from running it without oil. When you dont wik the filter the engine runs for up to 5 minutes without oil circulation.the dipstick is an estimated oil level not exact. This is why there’s a 1 inch area on it that is marked. There must be oil in this 1 inch area. If there isn’t DO NOT START RUN OR DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL YOU CORRECT IT! ALWAYS refer to your owners manual for the type of oil your car requires for the season you are in and  the capacity of oil needed. New cars need specific types of oil most much lighter viscosity than the older cars so NEVER ASSUME you know what you are doing  because this is the main cause of new cars having the warranty voided and people ending up with a brand new car with a blown engine. The other cause of voided warranty is someone who is not a certified technician doing what they think is maintenance but its not done properly by following the maintenance checklists. Regular joe car owners cannot get hold of the checklists for this reason.the warrantee companies will not carry the warranty on a vehicle that isn’t  maintained by a properly certified technician. This story is a prime example of someone who has no business being under the hood of any car messing around and doing things they have no business trying to do.', '', '', ' subisean:', '', 'Regular joe car owners cannot get hold of the checklists for this reason.the warrantee companies will not carry the warranty on a vehicle that isn’t maintained by a properly certified technician.', '', '', 'Checklist is a secret ?

It’s also possible the battery is weak and near the end of its life. All newer cars use a certain amount of current even when the engine is off and that might be enough if the battery is marginal. There are a couple of things you can try that don’t involve going to a mechanic. First, try a “trickle charger” that will maintain the battery. There are even solar powered ones.

However the check engine light did not come on this time. I told my mother what was happening, and she noticed the problem as well when she was driving the car back home.

Here is a story 13 I think you may like. Maybe you can guess which brand the other one in the story is?I recently had my Forester serviced this way: I had the stealership change the oil for about $60. They screed that up, so I had them do it again. While there, I bought the official Subaru engine air filter for about $25. I then bought a cabin air filter on Amazon for $11. I changed the cabin air filter myself. I then took the engine air filter and car to my local mechanic. He did everything in the owner’s manual for $160. That included changing the brake fluid. He listed every  single thing he did on the receipt in case I have a problem and need to prove it was done. This work quoted by my local Subaru dealer is $500.  I guess the extra $300 is added profit.Changing transmission and other fluids at 30K is a good idea, but no need to pay the dealer.  As others suggested, check with an independent mechanic and possibly just do some of the work yourself.  Not all of what the dealer recommended may be necessary.  Air filters are generally easy to do once you figure out the routine for your particular car.Folks like to argue about oil change intervals, hybrids too, so, do you think a dealer really does change fluids like receipt says?

Took it back to Betley in Salem NH, and they put a new radio in it. I’m getting the same issues. Also the radio goes on every time I start the truck up. Even though it is shut off, when I turn the ignition the radio goes on. I went back to Betley and 4 dealers and 1 manager did not know this, so I took them all outside and we went into 4 different trucks and the Colorado is the only one that does this if it has a 7\" screen. Tech support told them to perform a A11 on new radio and it still didn’t fix it. I’m on my second call with the attorney general because this is crazy stuff that no one is willing to fix. Think of the safety if the sound cranks up and I stir the wheel wrong from being scared out of my mind. Betley told me it was my problem.Also elevate your problem up the corporate chain.

Not even the Silverado, nor the big Traverse did the radio come on once the truck was started. So out of the 4 tested, 3 of them did not have the radio come back on when started. Funny thing is 3 dealers and 1 manager didn’t even know this truck did this, until I proved it to them. When my dealer went over the truck with me, not once was this brought up.I just went through the owners manual, looking for anything about the radio going on, when truck started. They is nothing to be found, either in Radio, or Informative System.What I meant about the owners manual was how to elevate your problem to corporate level.

Ever since, it has been having intermittent vibrations. I feel the vibrations mostly on the floor, but sometimes also on the steering wheel. Here’s what I’ve done so far:', 'When the vibrations started, i thought it was a problem with the new tires. I had them re-balanced 3 times at two different places, with no improvement. I then took the car to the dealer, who replaced two of the three engine mounts (it appears these tend to break easily on this model). This seemed to improve the situation for about half a day, and then it went back to the same. I took it back to the dealer, who could not find anything wrong. Not being satisfied, I took it to a different dealer, who could also not find anything wrong.', 'So, I am now stuck with this vibration…  It is not always there, and not always of the same magnitude… it seems to be more likely to happen in the morning after a colder night (well, as cold as it gets in Los Angeles). It is most likely to be felt at around 45-50mph, but you can also feel it at higher speed sometimes. A couple of times I could definitely feel it at around 25mph. Also, I’ve noticed that the engine vibrates when the car is stopped, at around 1500-1800rpm (e.g. when I first turn it on). The dealer claims that this is natural for a 4-cyl engine, but I had never felt a vibration before.', 'My gut feeling is that this is something related to the engine, but two different dealers could not find a problem… since this is intermittent, it is hard to nail down I guess. Any suggestions as to what this may be? Perhaps I could ask the dealer(s) to check specific things…', 'Thanks!I am thinking out load but  a good friend of mine has a 09 ford focus which shares a lot of commen parts w/mazda 3 he has a small shutter in his car’s torque conveter. or your mechanic that that the tires and the front brakes over torqued the lug nuts when he put the front tires back on the car. or did he cut the rotors or just clean them up? i would have someone check your front rotores for runout (warped) and retorque your wheels with a torque wrench( if you have alloy wheels)and not an impact gun.This vibration issue is always a slippery slope. I just spent way too much money and wayyy to many head-aches over leaking parts just to find out my new tires were crap.', 'Do you have anyone in your family with a similar wheel/tire size? Maybe find out on Tirerack if the wheel pattern is the same and get someone to loan you their wheels and tires for a drive. It is a pain and a lot of work swapping 2 sets of tires back and forth but it will rule out those tires you bought. That is how I found the tires were bad on my car. I didn’t have to look any further than my wife’s Dodge wheels that fit on my Chevy Monte Calro.Has anyone done a front to back rotation of the tires?  You could have a bent rim.You did two things to car at once. Tires and brakes. It seems you covered off tires mostly.', 'Maybe have another look at brakes. Our Subaru was exhibiting vibrations intermittently which turned out to be a seizing caliper. If you slam brakes does it go away?My tires balanced out perfectly on the balance machine… They just weren’t round tires. Mine were Uniroyal, I talked with the original installer and he suggested I contact Uniroyal about my issue. One phone call, two trips to a more local installer (one for inspection of the tires and a second for installing a different set) and i have 4 new Michelins on my  car for very little difference in my first purchase price. Mine were about 4 months old and had about 4Kmiles on them because my car had been in and out of other shops trying to chase down the vibrations.', 'I was concerned I had no recourse to tires I hated. It turns out we do.The intermittent and variable nature of the vibration tends to point away from tires.', 'I’m leaning towards an engine issue as the vibration is reported when the vehicle is idling - AND engine lounts improved it.CapriRacer', 'You could be correct on that assumption. I was just implying that just because a shop got the tires to balance doesn’t mean they are always smooth riding afterward.Thanks everyone for your input! I’ve had the tires rotated and unmounted/remounted several times, that did not seem to change anything. The shop also said they checked the tires and found them round… I’ve asked them a few times about the brakes, but they insist that nothing they did on the brakes could be causing this… plus I’ve been there so many times, that they are less than happy to see me at this point. Because of the intermittent nature of this, they have been unable (or unwilling?) to feel it, and told me I am ‘over-sensitive’ to vibrations… which of course is not true, since everything was fine until I had the work done.', 'If it is an intermittently seizing caliper, is that something that can be easily diagnosed?', 'Thanks again!W30post: the idea of swapping wheels for a day also occurred to me, but I haven’t found anyone whose wheels match perfectly… so I was wondering, how dangerous is it to use wheels that are somewhat different?Also, it does not seem to go away if I brake (gently) while it is vibrating… If I were to slam the brakes, it would go below 45mph quickly, at which point there is no vibration anyway…I don’t think it is the brakes.  You need to have someone put a dial indicator on the wheels, not the tires but on the lip of the rim and rotate the tire to see if the rim is bent.  Rims can get bent during the unmounting of the old tires from them (not from removing the wheels from the car).Another test that can be performed with a dial indicator is for wheel bearing play.  If the dial indicator indicates that a rim is bent, before changing the rim, have the brake rotor removed and checked for trash or a rust buildup which can make a rim appear to be bent, even when it is not.If the offset is slightly different, the total diameter is slightly bigger, those things will not matter. I looked up your car with some guesses and it has a large offset. Bolt pattern is key. You do not want to stress the lugs at all. rim diameter may be a consideration because of brake clearance.If the shop does not have a dial indicator for this task, then they might just pull the wheels and the rotors and clean the surface of the hub and the inside of the rotor where they mate.  Sometimes that’s all it takes.The Mazda 3  has a common problem with the passenger side engine mount that can cause vibration.   It’s not hard to remove and check it.   The link below has more info.', 'http://www.mazda3forums.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=a0b3e8c23ea1879eb7867a18176881b1&topic=119411.0 29My VW with many more miles at the time had intermittent vibration while traveling at freeway speeds.  It was a CV joint going bad.thanks all for your ideas! I just took the car to a newly paved road that’s almost perfectly flat, and was able to get the vibration at around 20-25mph. Not as intense, but definitely there (it would be nice to see if the vibration was at half the frequency as well, but could not tell). My guess is that at such low speeds the tires and rotors should not have enough moment to cause a vibration (correct?).', 'The next thing I am itching to try is to tape my camera phone under the hood, and record video of the engine as I drive… that would be cool in itself, but may also give me some evidence I can rub in the dealer’s face. Now', 'About the lugs: on the second-to-last time I took the car to the place where they mounted my tires, they said they made sure the wheels were torqued to factory spec. They also told me they checked the rims, and they looked fine…', 'My fear is that this will be a combination of things (e.g., a little off-round tires, a slightly warped rotor, a slightly defective engine mount) that all resonate to cause this…I would caution strapping you Iphone under the hood. The engine heat may be too much and kill the display.', 'The vibration caused by my bad tires was also present at the low speeds, also present intermittently. The shop that said they were round, is it the same shop that installed them the first time?Before I forget to comment on this, wheels that are slightly different may not fit.  If they DO fit on the lugs, you may have issues with the speedometer misreading your actual speed, and you MAY have some small issues with a tranfer case.  Now, these issues won’t be bad if you’re going for a quick spin around the block, but there’s just something telling me it’s not a good idea.', 'In any case, if you’re getting the vibration when you’re idling, forget the wheels and brakes entirely - unless you have 2 problems going on.', 'Check your spark plugs and injectors, maybe even spark plug coils.

I questioned how this could be, but the mechanic didn’t have much of a response. I then called the dealership and asked them about it. They stated that I hardly ever drove the car (10,000 miles per year) and that condensation was most likely pitting and rusting the rotors due to the fact that it “sits too much”. I drive in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic every day so I’m on the brakes alot. I have owned many cars in the past and I am NOT heavy on the brakes at all. My other cars rotors have always lasted at least 60,000 miles in the same type of driving conditions.', '', ' Does anyone have any idea what could have caused the rotors to be pitted and rusted and yet the pads still have 6 months wear on them? I’m at a loss on this one.It does not seem quite right to me either.  You can get underneath the car to look at the rotors with a mirror and flashlight.  You can see some portions of the rotors through the wheels too.  Make sure that the swept area of the rotor as much as you can see, has not been reduced due to corrosion.  The swept area shoulld be as wide as your brake pads.  Go to car parts store to inspect a new pad for your car as a reference; they should be willing to accommodate you; if not find another store where your business might be welcomed.', 'By the way, there is no rule to prevent you from buying the parts and having a mechanic install them for you.', 'Normally, a little rust will be polished off with a few brake applications.', 'If you do get the rotors replaced, then ask for the old parts.  This will help to keep your mechanic honest or else get a second opinion.  I have doubts that all four must be replaced but anything is possible.Consider this approach.  You may need to replace the rotors, so check and see if your independent mechanic can find the Wagner rotors with lifetime warranty.  I see where O’Reilly Auto sells the rears for around 47.99, which is not much more than getting regualar rotors with a time warranty.  see if you can get the fronts that way, too.  At least that minimizes the cost of the rotors if the pitting occurs again.', '10K miles should be enough to keep the rotors in good shape, in my opinion.  If there is any doubt about the two opinions offered by the mechanic and dealer, find an independent mech who can provide you with another opinion about why it happened.I 2nd the opinion on checking the rotor swept area.  However ensure you check both sides of the rotor which is best done if the wheel is removed.  You may have a pad which is not contacting the rotor due to rust/dirt on the caliper sliding pin preventing full pad contact.It is perfectly normal for rotors to rust on the outer edges and at their center.', 'Depending on atmospheric conditions, sometimes rust can speckle the rotors after a vehicle has only been sitting for a day or two. A few stops and it’s gone; no problem.', 'Regarding this grinding noise you’re getting; does this occur with every stop or only for a few stops after the vehicle has been sitting overnight, etc.?[b]What you’re describing isn’t all that uncommon.', 'Pitted rotors are a result of inferior metal casting practices. When molten metal is poured into a casting, it must be done at a certain rate. If it’s poured too quickly, gas bubbles can form in the molten metal and leave voids in the casted material. These voids aren’t seen in the newly casted component.', 'When this happens with brake rotors, as the rotor surfaces wear, these voids begin to be exposed. And this is called rotor pitting.', 'Because these pits are below the friction surfaces of the rotors, rust forms in them because the brake pads can’t remove the rust. This rust builds up in the pits to where the rotor wears and the pads come in contact with this rust. This rust then begins to contaminate the brake pads. And an iron oxide contaminated brake pad or shoe will grind everytime the brakes are applied.', 'So, if the rotors are truely pitted, you need new rotors.', 'Tester[/b]Your brake rotors were made with slave labor from “recycled” cast iron scrap. We did you expect? Benz quality? Sorry…That wasn’t very nice.Thank you for your suggestion. I wasn’t aware that there were brake rotors with lifetime warranties. I think I will follow your suggestion and purchase the lifetime rotors so I avoid any future problems.', 'Thanks a bunch!Just be careful of any wear item that carries a lifetime warranty. All companies are in business to make money. If there’s a lifetime warranty on a part that is expected to wear out, there must be some way they can still make money on them. When a shop offers this type of warranty, they make it up on the labor to replace them. Sometimes, they actually wear out faster so they can replace them more often. Parts are free, labor is not.While crudely put, Caddyman’s response was correct.  “White box” rotors are made in China from low quality recycled metals and the labor is frequently prison (i.e. forced) labor.  You should always stick with name brand rotors and resist the temptation to go cheap.  At the end of the day you never go cheap on tires or brakes.  A cheap spark plug won’t kill you but bad brakes and/or tires are a recipe for disaster.These were the original brake rotors and pads installed by Hyundai. I did not sacrifice safety nor would I ever dream of doing so. Are you suggesting that Hyundai is using slave prison labor from China to produce their brake parts?any other hyundai owners out there who can comment on the brake/ rotor longevity?    im curious because the huge warantee hyundai gives MUST have SOME catch??!!', 'right?You can ask your mechanic to turn, or have turned by a parts store, your rotors. American cars have a stamped minimum thickness imprinted on them for how thick the rotors have to be, MINIMUM, for turning purposes. If you decide to have the rotors turned, (usually material is removed on a lathe-type machine in .001\" increments), that’ll get the rotors down to new, clean metal. Then any cracks or really deep pits will show up. If they’re marginal, toss \\'em and replace with new. It is always better to get rotors turned where both inside and outside surfaces are turned (cut) at the same time. Reduces/eliminates warpage during the turning process, but a good machine operator can cut one surface at a time if he/she cuts in shallow, slow increments. Sharp cutting tools are an absolute must. Dull cutters= crappy results. Of course, new pads get put on whenever you do any rotor work. Don’t ever let anyone cut more than the mandatory minimum. Rotors dissipate heat as they’re used. Too thin rotors crack, warp, and sometimes just flat-out disintegrate because they don’t have the proper thickness of metal to properly and safely dissipate the extreme heat that all brake systems generate. Guess when the most heat is generated? Emergency stops. Would you want your rotors to break during an emergency stop? The for-sure repair is to replace both rotors and pads with new. But if you implicitely trust your mechanic, ask his/her opinion. Cutting the old rotors down might turn out to be a waste of time and money, but it is another option that you might consider. Vehicle business happens where the rubber meets the road, including the brake system. Most times, it doesn’t matter how fast you can go. It matters more how fast you can stop. Of course, a good mechanic will check out the rest of your brake systems for leaks, cracked hoses, etc. Don’t cheat on the brake system. Your safety, health, well-being and life depend on those brakes. The same goes for other human beings and animals.I just re-checked your original post. Only 26K miles? You probably don’t need to change out the brake fluid. However, another little trick that I do is to use a plastic turkey baster to remove as much fluid as I can from the master cylinder and replace with fresh, new fluid of the appropriate type. Again, ask your mechanic’s opinion. On my old junk, \\'92 Olds Cutlass ciera, \\'71 Chevy-10 L-6 engine, van with no power nothing, \\'85 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, (a.k.a.: Dragoneer), \\'92 GMC G-20 van, and my S.O.\\'s \\'89 Toyota Corolla AllTrac, (265K on it), I use all of these little tricks. With this old stuff, I completely flush the brake lines with denatured alcohol, blow air through the lines, completely replace the fluid, bleed and adjust. Of course, “while I’m at it”, I also carefully inspect the rubber seals on the ‘slave’ cylinders, just for the heck of it. Any cracks or leaks get fixed. The \\'71 van has 187K+, the \\'92 van has only 156K,(ONLY? ??), and the Dragoneer has about 147K. I won’t even discuss the \\'56 Allis-Chalmers WD-45 farm tractor. No gauges except for oil pressure and amp meter. I like old stuff. Old stuff works if properly maintained. Heck–I’M old stuff–and I still work pretty well.(Heh! Heh!

I have seen a few guys never use a slow cut and make the final pass or two on the highest speed the lathe will run at. That gives a poor finish and should be avoided.

At near 300k miles on the original rotors they have never needed to be turned nor do they show any run out or parallelism issues.When a set of rotors is within a few dollars of machining the old ones why bother machining I say. But when replacement is more than double the cost of machining and the old rotors will be within spec after cleaning them up I go for that option and for years I had a brake lathe that used abrasive discs that resurfaced the friction surface of rotors and left a ‘better than original’ mating surface while removing less metal than cutting them.The #1 enemy of rotors is heat. If the original rotor is substantially heavier than an aftermarket replacement, it is better to turn. That being said, I usually don’t use high end rotors and would be a waste of time to turn the ones I use.As always there is a great deal of professional discretion available in determining the “best” solution to repairing and maintaining automobiles and we each must take our best shot based on past experience @tcmichnorth. And yes, the OE rotors are often up to resurfacing while many after markets aren’t.  And when in doubt erring to the side of caution is worthwhile. Comebacks are a great deal more costly than minor customer annoyance of the price.It’s true that carmakers don’t make their own rotors. They do usually spec a higher quality part than much of what’s available on the aftermarket. For that reason, it makes sense to keep the OEM ones as long as they are OK, and if they can be machined with good workmanship, do that. If and when they are too thin, or warped, it’s time for new ones.', 'I have found good results at a reasonable price with whatever rotors the people at NAPA say they use themselves, and poor results with some other aftermarket rotors.

Unfortunately, a month in, and between the receipts and the tissues and the napkins, my vow is standing on shaky ground.  Thus started the search for waste bins for vehicles.

As an auto technician I have literally seen insurance companies total out a perfectly good but smelly car just due to the smell. And think like this…that smell carries diseases that can kill you if you are exposed to it long enough. Thats why dead animals and such are considered biohazards. If that critter was carrying any disease that could infect a human you’ll get it because if you are smelling it you are inhaling those diseases as they are evacuating the corpse.

Some that are used for cabs in New York City have a great deal of miles on them.  Why are you asking ?We were thinking of buying a 2012 Prius for $6000 and it has 165,000 miles. Our 2003 Prius had to have both battery and Inverter assembly replaced for about $7000. If we buy this car, how long will it be till it also needs them replaced. Which would double the price. That might not be that bad, but I am just weighing options. I asked the car agent and he said that he did not see those repairs done in the report.', 'Thanks for your quick response!', 'NancyOK , you pay 6000.00 for a 8 year used vehicle then the battery fails and you spend another 7000.00  . That makes no sense at all.  No one can predict when you will need these repairs.', 'Have you looked at Kelly Blue Book because I would never buy a Hybrid used with that many miles.I don’t know where you live, but if you’re really okay with spending $6k + $7k = $13k, Kelly Blue Book shows that you can get a 2014 with around 50,000 miles on it from a dealer for about that much money. There’s always a risk, but I would be inclined to go with the newer car with many fewer miles on it.The Toyota hybrid system is usually very reliable/durable. It’s fairly unusual to need to replace the inverter, and aftermarket companies can replace the battery for a reasonable price. If you have the VIN for the vehicle you can sign up on the owners section of the Toyota website and pull the full dealership maintenance history. That might give you more insight into what repairs have already been performed. Definitely a gamble with the higher mileage but not necessarily a bad purchase in my opinion.']\n",

Immediately it gave her issues, battery started draining so I bought a new one and he replaced it. Alternator died. Bought one for her. Replaced it. Battery died again. Bought. Replaced it.

Something else that is connected to the power bus has a problem. Apparently people that have worked on it already haven’t found the real problem. Whatever it is, in order for a current drain to happen, the load has to be connected to the power source to allow current to flow. From what you say about the multiple battery replacements I wonder if there really is an excessive current draw problem.

One episode is in part about the subject of tetraethyl lead and the scientist back in the 1960’s who investigated whether or not it was introducing lead into the environment.    Anyway, there’s a short cartoon segment in which the scientist gets into his car, then turns the key counterclockwise to start the engine.  This seemed sort of weird to me, probably just a mistake during editing.  But then I got to wondering if there are indeed cars in which the key has to be turned counterclockwise to start?', 'Are there any cars – past or present – in which you turn the key in the counterclockwise direction to start the car?  And any speculations why most cars use the clockwise direction?There may well be a car that needs ccw turn though I do not know of one. Different manufactures have been doing reverse things forever. In the days of single sided keys, gm points on the key went down, chrysler went up. crank windows clockwise for own in gm, counter clockwise in dodge etc, I think it even applies to electric windows, some pull up to lower the window, others push down.I feel confident that someone designed a CCW ignition cylinder at some time in the past.', 'After all, if Chrysler designed CCW threads on their wheel studs on one side (and they did), nothing is too dumb!', 'Don’t bother with the technical explanation guys, I already know it. It was dumb anyway.Chrysler Corp. was not the only automaker to use left hand threads on the drivers side.  It was an engineering decision. With left hand threads on the left side , loose lug nuts have less tendency to come off.I am not familiar with the art in drawing a cartoon cel, but I wonder if it was drawn clockwise and in the process of transferring to film if it got turned around.

Not necessarily mechanically inclined but it could have gotten reversed too.While I have driven some vehicles with starter switches that would not be recognized by many and likely no one younger than 40 would know what to do to crank the engine on quite a few models but I have never seen a CCW crank position.

My Austin Healey Sprite MK1 had a button on the dash. The turn signal switch was a 3 way toggle next to it. I’m sure most of the youngsters think the starter buttons on some modern cars is a new invention. Was it Buicks that had the starter switch under the accelerator pedal?Yes Buicks had it under the gas pedal, and Studebakers had it under the clutch pedal.  And it was real common to have a big push pedal over the gas, through the firewall, until right after WWII.  A 52 Hillman Minx had a pull knob on the dash.  Fords had the key slot on the left side of the dash in the 50’s and 60’s.  You could turn the key to OFF and pull it out, and then turn the car on and off without the key on GM cars around 1960 or so.  You had to turn it to LOCK to really lock up the ignition.Bing, there might be another reason. I saw an interview in TV once where they said that the city they were filming in required that they wear their badges on the wrong side (in order to get their permits) to prevent the citizenry from mistaking the actors for real cops.That’s interesting and would certainly explain it.  It really looked goofy though with the badge on the right.My hazy memory seesm to recall some older cars that had a CCW ignition switch but I simply can’t  coax a brain cell into remembering for certain.', 'Ford trucks in the 50s/60s (???) maybe with a dashboard mounted switch to the left of the steering column?

I’ve never seen a vehicle where you turn the ignition CCW though.

I remember it well. The ignition switch was on the dash.I thought the neutral safety switch on the 1948 Pontiac with the Hydramatic automatic transmission was interesting.  The starter was activated  by a pedal on the floor above the accelerator.  Stepping on the pedal also pushed down on the accelerator, pushed the starter pinion gear into the flywheel and then closed the switch sending power to the starter motor.  On the Hydramatic equipped models, a lever from the starter pedal,put the selector in neutral.  The shift sequence was,N D L R.  There was no park position.  The  car was parked with the selector in reverse.  Stepping on the starter moved the selector into N.  This was,a great system–no starter solenoid to give problems–no neutral safety switch to act up.  The 1949 Pontiac had a pushbutton on the dashboard to actvate the starter solenoid,and there was an electrical neutral safety switch.  However, for one year, GM got it right in the 1948 Pontiac.  By the way,_1948 was the first year for an automatic transmission in the Pontiac.I guess we are a bunch of “senior citizens”?']\n",

      "['About two years ago, I noticed the smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin of my 2000 Honda Civic any time the vents were set to pull air from outside the cabin.  Switching the vents to recirculate would prevent the fumes.  Looking under the hood, I found the exhaust manifold was cracked, so I replaced it along with the catalyic converter (actually one piece in this model) and two O2 sensors.  Since the replacement, the problem with exhaust fumes remains.  I have asked my mechanic to look at this a couple of times, and he could not find the cause.  I’m looking for suggestions on what to try next to diagnose the problem.  We use the car frequently, and just have to leave the vents set on recirculate.  This becomes an issue on rainy, humid days when recirculate causes the windows to fog.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.Do you have a carbon monoxide sensor?  You might bring one into the car and test the air with the recirc on and off.  That will tell you if you have a CO build-up.  You can always buy one if you don’t have one and use it in your house after testing the car.  Most run on 120-AC; you may need a converter for the car, too.Other sources of exhaust fumes under the hood include the EGR and riser pipe. There is also a sensor on the EGR pipe that checks for EGR flow. This sensor generally has two small pipes and flex lines that attach to the EGR riser pipe. A break or crack in any of these can also allow exhaust fumes into the engine compartment.What about a slow leak around the valve cover seal?  I usually see some grim around the seal.  If I wipe it clean, it will build up again in a few weeks.  Could that leaking oil be burning when the block get hot and causing fumes?  I haven’t had to add oil to the car between changes, so it can’t be leaking much oil.Hi Jonblack1234,', 'I have the same car and the same smell.  I’ve taken it to my local mechanic and he is stumped so I did some research and found your link.', 'Did you find the problem that was causing this smell?It could be something other than exhaust fumes being noticed.

And might mimic the smell of an exhaust leak.  As will transmission fluid leaks.', 'Are there any fluid drip-stains under where you park the car at night?

When I warm up the car, I’ve stopped turning on the heat and that seems to keep the smell from building inside the car, but I can smell the fumes pretty strong around the outside of the car. Once I’m driving and not idling the smell is faint (I think it just comes in when I open the door to get in) and eventually fades out. Sometimes I crack the window while driving to pull the smell out. I’m looking for answers, but I don’t see where anyone said they found a solution. I’m hoping to eventually find an answer. I have no idea if this will stop like last winter or continue on.A mechanic should be able to check your exhaust system for any leaks, and check if any oil is dripping onto it, which causes fumes. Do you see any oil leaks?', 'What is the make model year miles for your car?OK , once again I don’t understand this situation .  Someone has a problem with smelling exhaust fumes that can make a person very ill or even be fatal … Instead of having a shop solve this they ask a bunch of strangers on the web what to do .  Because I have found tons of solutions to different problems with both of my cars by seeking online where people have shared when the same situation happened with them and they already did the troubleshooting. Why reinvent the wheel if not necessary. If I don’t find a way to fix it then I will gladly take it to my mechanic.Unless you have the equipment needed to elevate your car so you can safely inspect the entire exhaust system, and have access to an exhaust leak detector, this is better left to a pro.  And it is a major safety issue, if it is an exhaust leak.There’s a good locally-owned muffler shop in many towns. That’s where I take my exhaust problems. They’ve seen it all and know where to look.']\n",

Many will be at 0.1% or lower while the cheaper unit will have 10% at max power, if they even list the THD at all.  Most cheap units won’t because it is not good.', 'THD is very important as it caused by clipping the signal.  Think of a spring.  Let’s say the initial stiffness of the spring is 1kG per cm of stretch or compression.  For the first 5 cm, it is pretty consistent.  5cm of compression or stretch requires 5kG, 3cm requires 3kG etc.  But as you go beyond 5cm, it requires more than 1kG for every cm, say 6.5kG to go to 6cm, 8.5kG to reach 7, 11kG to reach 8cm and 20kG to reach 9cm.  You. are approaching the limits of the spring.  To go from 5 to 9 cm require an additional 15kG.', 'An amplifier has limits too.  For example a 0.01v to 0.1v input may produce a 1 to 10 watt output that is linear.  But above a 0.1v input, less power out is produced so the output curve will start to flatten out.  When that happens, the amplifier starts to produce harmonics that did not exist in the original signal, thus distorting the input.', 'This is only one way the more expensive amplifier is worth the extra cost.  There are quite a few other parameters to be considered as well but this post would get way too long.  But the cost/quality curve is also non linear.  You might get a head unit that is 5x better than the cheapest one for only 2 to 3x the cost, but after that, the next 10% increase in quality could cost you 10x as much.', 'I would also not waste money on a sub unless you listen to music that has low frequency tones.

I suspected a head gasket minor leak and as I took the head off the block, I noticed the exhaust manifold is super rusted near the mating surface with the block.  Please see the pics.  https://stellar7.org/05civic/ 29       I’m not a professional mechanic so I have no experience to judge how bad it is.  I can see carbon buildup around the duct perimeters and a bit further in the case of the outer 2 ducts.  Looking at the pic of the front of the manifold, I don’t see any obvious metal fatigue failure.', 'I’ve heard that these manifolds have a manufacturer defect where they crack in the center outer part of the ducts and the mating surface bows. Based on the photos, it appears the outer ducts may be sealing less?', 'Is the amount of rust on the mating surface too much to seal properly with a new gasket?  Can it be sanded down?  I doesn’t appear the mating surface was designed to be completely flat… there is a rectangular area in the center that protrudes the main surface…  I wonder if sanding that part down is inconsequential?', 'Are there any tolerances on curvature like there is on the head?', 'Any advice is appreciated.Don’t be too agressive when cleaning it up', 'this might be sufficient', 'image960×512 65.4 KB', 'you clearly need to remove any rust that is loose and flaking off, but not so much “good” metal that it won’t seal up', 'After cleaning it up, you can throw a straightedge on it and give us a few figures, if you like.

But I wouldn’t go out and buy a straightedge, if you don’t already possess oneDoesn’t look that bad to me. As long as there aren’t chunks coming off I’d probably slap it back on the car with a new gasket. Exhaust gaskets are squishy, so they’ll conform to ripples in the mating surface.', 'That header is made out of cast iron, and that stuff rusts at the drop of a hat, so seeing rust there is not at all surprising. The tolerances are basically “Is it leaking? If not, it’s fine.” Most exhaust manifolds look a lot worse than that after  5 or 6 years  .   Just get the loose stuff  off with a brush  and be happy you were able to get the studs off , LOL .OEM exhaust manifolds are usually very thick cast metal. It would take decades for any rust to cause a problem. Clean it up…And paint it if you want. Make sure to use high-temp paint.Doesn’t look particularly bad or anything to me.  Cast iron is gonna rust.  If you want you can get a metal wire brush and see if you can get some the mating surfaces cleaned up a bit. Or you can get stainless steel header and call it good.']\n",

In 2014 I bought a 2002 Explorer that had a noisy differential, no A/C, and electrical issues that made the windows not work and the battery die overnight. I paid $2400 for the car, fixed it for $300 in parts, drove it for 50,000 miles, and sold it in 2017 for $2200. Two years ago I bought a 2006 Trailblazer for $3400. It had a grinding noise from the engine, the fuel gauge didn’t work, the A/C was stuck on full hot, and the check engine light was on. Fixed it for $250 in parts and have put 35,000 miles on it, though I did buy new tires last year.', 'On the other hand, my wife tends to keep cars a long time.

It is the dealer installed plate bracket/frame that the plate screws into on the front bumper of the car. And apparently this model (2020 Fusion Hybrid SE) only comes with two front floor mats? Even the Focus I had came with a full set of 4 floor mats. I think every car I’ve ever had came with all 4 mats.If only two screws were used and they went through the upper holes on the plate to the lower holes on the bumper, then it is wrong, but now damage was done.

      "['Hello: I have a 1989 Dodge Ram utility truck, V-6. It has been stalling out randomly. First: The bottom radiator hose slips off, I have reconnected and placed a death grip on the clamp, I am hoping that is the fix for that. The battery is draining, I am going to replace the battery. I disconnected the battery and the truck stays on. I believe this may eliminate the alternator, but not sure. The last time it cranked on, I turned it off. I let it sit for a few minutes, I go to crank it back on and only a clicking noise. The battery shows 88% and that is from an overnight charge from 100%. Is that a possible cause for the truck to stall out? I’m not sure about the Amps, but I believe it to be about 600 Amps which may or may not be enough to crank the truck on. The truck will stall and after a certain amount of time crank back up. It sounds great while it’s running. No oders, no white smoke from the tail pipe, nothing leaking. I am trying to figure out a way to test the spark plugs but I’m still researching that. I’m no mechanic and blind as a bat with this now, any help would be great. What to do bext? I am wanting to fix this myself as I am on a tight budget. I have no special tools just some good ole wrenches and muscle. I gratefuly accept any tips, tricks, suggestions or any feedback at all.First, with engine cold, remove radiator cap. Then start the engine and look for bubbles in the coolant. Then do a wet\\\\dry compression test. If both of these tests pass, you can then move on to the separate electrical issue.Hey tcmichnorth: Thank you. I have removed the cap. I did crank it up, It’s hard to tell if it warmed up to normal temp, but it did start bubling and even overflowing the radiator. I’ll have to look into a wet/dry compression test, I never have done that. I believe along with that I need to check the spark plugs/wires. When it’s running, it sounds great, no leaks, no smoke smooth idle, then it stalls and all I get a click and right now, I’m not even getting that. I will work that wet/dry compression test and keep you up to date. Thanks for the help.  Cheers.Bubbles in the coolant?  That’s not good and would indicate a possible head gasket failure.  Do the chemical test for that before spending any more time or money.  That wouldn’t cause stalling though but a poor battery could.Hey Bing: I did not describe that correctly. sorry. The water was more than just warm, it was moving and overflowing over the radiator, No bubbles. Again, my mistake. The idea of a poor battery causing a stall is actually and hopeful thought. I have no problem with replacing the battery and I am going to do that as soon as I am able to get to a parts store. Having no transport and living where I do, well, it about a 2 hour walk to the nearest store and that really slows progress down. LOL! So, right now it looks like the next, is the chemical test and  replace the battery. Thanks for any help.You can’t perform a compression test with a dead battery, sounds like you need a new battery and not a compression test. Monitor the battery voltage with the engine off, while cranking the engine and while running.', 'When operating the engine with the radiator cap off the coolant will expand and spill over, that is normal, you don’t need a chemical test.Just how old is that battery?', 'If it’s more than 5yrs old, it might be wiser to just replace it and be done with it', 'It might be unable to hold a charge . . . or you might have a parasitic drain', 'Google “parasitic drain test” . . . I’m sure there are plenty of guys that have posted the procedure.  This is something you can perform quickly and cheaply. 50 milliamps is the limit, by the way', 'what do you mean when you say the radiator hose slips off . . . ?', 'Can I presume you have a plastic/aluminum radiator?', 'If so, are you sure, the plastic neck isn’t damaged, and that’s why the radiator hose is slipping off?Nevada_545 Thanks.Hey db4690: The battery is at least 5 years old. So, yes I am replacing it. I believe the first time I installed the hose, I did not place the clamp on correctly, or I did not tighten it enough; and after driving a few miles it simply slipped off. The radiator is aluminum, with a plastic top and plastic connecting ports. Other than improper install, I have no idea of what could have caused the bottom hose to disconnect on it’s own. When I installed it again this time. I muscled and checked to make sure the hose could go no further against the connection port and I tightened the clamp till I could no longer turn the screw. I am hoping that is a fix as I have not yet been able to test drive. I’ll google the “parasitic drain test.” Thanks for the response.OK, bubbling versus bubbles?  Over-flowing no bubbles?  I stand corrected.  No need to check for combustion in the coolant at this point.Hey Bing: Yeah, sometimes I’m not good at describing details, but it is correct that over-flowing with no bubbles. I’m glad it does not need a combustion check, but I have made a note of that for future reference. I appreciate all responses. So, thanks.The reason we were looking for bubbles in the radiator was to see if compressed air from a cylinder was being pushed into the cooling system through the head gasket. If the head gasket was leaking you would have seen air bubbles very shortly after starting it. The reason we went down this road was blowing hoses are a symptom of blown head gasket. The compression test would be to confirm or deny the results. These are two quick and easy tests to eliminate the possibility of a bad head or gasket. Seeing as it passed the bubbles test, @Nevada_545 is right. You need to bypass the compression test and get a new battery. I would be sure to clean battery cables at battery and where the battery grounds and starter and alternator connectors. That may resolve your problems but some good insurance would be to do a parasitic draw test as @db4690 suggested.Do you hav an Autozone in your area? My understanding is that they will now make home deliveries. Even batteries.Tricks? We got tricks. This won’t help but open the hood at night and look for sparks jumping off the plug wires. A 63 Ford would put on a really good show. If you see a light show, change the wires.', '', '', ' Scott-262:', '', 'I disconnected the battery and the truck stays on.', '', '', 'Don’t do that again!

I saw where people have mention the pcm4less, or something like that, but I’m not sure how exactly it works or what it can do. Even if I could go the other way, towards better gas milage, that would be fine as well. Kinda wondering about the range of modifications in terms of difficulty, efficiency, and of course cost. Thank you all.My Traiblazer 6 cyl was just fine, never felt the need to worry about performance increases. Are things going south?I’d bet a dozen donuts that the pcm place is worthless.  I’d be surprised if there was any inexpensive way to get hp, you typically need to add a turbo or a supercharger, at great expense.  Money would be better spent getting it in top mechanical condition.PCM4Less is a tuning company. You either go to their facility in Ohio or you send your engine control computer to them and they change the parameter file in the computer to boost whatever you ask them to try and boost, horsepower or mileage.', 'Since your 6 has no turbo or supercharger from the factory, there is little you can gain in HP. Turbo cars can command higher boost and therefore higher HP. Tunes can work very well for those engines. To boost HP on your 6, timing is increased and will require premium fuel all the time… for 10-15 hp added to your 270 hp.', 'As for other modifications… the follow-up question to “how much HP can I get” is  is always “how much can you spend?”', 'This is not  a popular engine, there are not too many parts available. To make more power, you’d need new cams, valvesprings, upgraded intake system and exhaust including headers.

Figure $500 for the dyno time and $500 for the guy that does the tune.

      "['I just bought a 1991 Chevrolet K1500 and I have a question about the 4WD. Can I switch to 4-high “on the fly”–as in while the vehicle is moving–or do I have to be parked/stopped/or in neutral? The guy at the used car lot didn’t seem to know for sure, but my neighbor said “no problem,” to shift it to 4-high from 2WD as long as I’m not going too fast. Is this true? I don’t want to trash my car! I don’t know much about 4WD on older cars. I’m used to “push button” 4WD on newer models. Also, what’s the highest safe speed for 4WD? High and low…Thanks!Would you like to be safe or sorry? Check the owner’s manual if there is one. I have driven a Ford at 40 MPH on really icy roads and hills with ordinary tires and had no problem. 4L would be kind of risky when moving. 4H you could probably do when moving.Maybe the manual is in the dash, we have a few gmc vehicles of that era and have always engaged 4wd before moving, 4wd should be used cautiously and sparingly imho. 4 lo you will not need unless pulling a boat out of a sandy launch etc. In fact I would skip using 4wd except when absolutely necessary and never over 40 mph. But then again that is my experience with early 90’s vintage vehicles still working fine.You should be able to shift between 2H and 4H on the fly as long as you are going straight ahead and all the wheels have equal traction. Now if your vehicle has some sort of “automatic locking hubs” you must stop first as the front axle is not “live” until SOMETHING engages the front hubs. Your truck may have a live axle which is engaged all the time, 2-wheel or 4 wheel drive…On older trucks, many were equipped with manually locking hubs where you had to stop and get out and lock or unlock the front hubs…SERIOUS off-roaders still favor this fool-proof set-up…', 'You can ALWAYS shift from 4H to 2H, that’s no problem. But be gentle when first trying to go from 2wd to 4wd on the fly. If the transfer case lever will snap in with no gear clashing, then you have a live front axle and can shift on the fly. If you get gear grinding, forget it, stop before you engage 4wd…', 'Now if your vehicle has some sort of “automatic locking hubs” you must stop first as the front axle is not “live” until SOMETHING engages the front hubs', '', \"My 84 GMC pickup with auto-locking hubs could be switched into 4wd-hi at speeds under 50.

What fun!We do some serious rock crawling  out here in Tucson. Most of mine was with a 71 Wagoneer (yes they did very well). If the situation presented itself that I needed 4 low I would always come to a complete stop when the really rough stuff stopped and then shift to 4h (Dana 20 transfer case)Never felt the need to experement with my equipment when I was in 4low country, you always take the conservative route when dealing with country that requires 4 low, just to far back in to get stuck.\", 'I leave the snow stuff to thoses “other” 4 wheelers.I appreciate replies to my question, but the sarcasm isn’t very helpful. I’m new to this style of 4WD truck and I’m asking an honest question and hoping for useful advice. I have no idea how to take this response.I don’t anticipate using 4-low very often–or ever. I simply want to know when it is safe to engage the 4WD-high when conditions go from dry pavement to snow and ice. Do I have to pull over, stop the car, put it in neutral before I shift? Or can I just shift into 4WD while driving when the conditions change? The manual offers no advice in this regard. I experimented this weekend and found that it seems to shift into 4-hi no problem. It usually takes a few second for the light on the floor to indicate that the front axle is engaged, but it seems to shift in and out no problem. I haven’t tried it at speeds over 30 mph. I do need the 4WD for driving up the mountain on snow and ice.You can engage while moving. Just make sure wheels are nearly dead straight and you are not slipping. If it seems to engage or disengage hard using a slight application of throttle will help.', 'Usually the safe high speed is around 50MPH or so. Basically if you need 4wd and need to go faster than 50-60MPH then something is wrong.', 'In my 4wd vehicles I have used (Toyota 4runner, Pickup, Suburban, Subaru) all the 4wd info was usually printed on the backside of the sun visors.I used to own a similar vintage K2500 4x4.

I’ve seen them for around $15 and worth every penny IMO.You should be able to go from 2H to 4H when moving.  I’d try a slower speed engagement at first, say 15 to 20 mph and do this on a dirt or gravel road.  You have an older truck and the condition of the transfer case, front diff, and hubs could be questionable.  If everything seems to work OK, then you can try it at higher speeds.  Above 50 it can be too big a jolt to the system if something isn’t right.

I just recalled that I had to start in neutral with last starter!!! Would a bad TPS be causing this???A bad TPS sensor, or the wiring to it, will not cause the starter to make a loud clunking sound. The sound you are hearing can be caused by a couple of things. One is the engine is locked up and the starter can’t turn it over. Do not force the starter to stay ON if that is the case. You will burn up the battery cable due to high current flow. The second thing that can cause the issue is the main battery cable to the starter has internal corrosion to the wires at the battery due to battery acid leaching into the cable. That causes high resistance and will block the power needed to run the starter motor when the solenoid turns on and connects the motor to the battery. I suspect that is what is happening in your case. The engine is fine and you need to replace the main cable to the starter. Check the main ground cable also.

Your hubby probably learned his practice based on the “remove the condensation on the inside of the windshield” goal. He’s actually doing the correct thing, my preference aside.The heat comes from inside the evaporator where the refrigerant is converted into a low pressure gas. When this occurs, that gas reaches a certain temperature when contained in the evaporator. Usually between 40? to 50?. In the summer when it’s hot, this gas will absorb heat out of the air cooling it. When the temperature is cold, this gas still reaches a temperature of between 40? to 50? in the evaporator.

Most cars these days (that use analog gauges) use stepper motors to drive speedo and tacho needles. I have successfully come to a point where I captured some data about my drive from OBDII port and wired up my motors to test rig. Now I dont know how often speed and rpm values are sampled usually, but in my car I can only get them at 180ms intervals from OBDII port. If I “play” captured values to my cluster, the motors jerk (probably because sampling rate is too low).

Since the gauges are getting their data from a computer, that computer is likely to be giving a PREDICTED data.  The computer can see the car speed and engine speed rapidly rising, and compute the acceleration and use this to smoothly predict a future value (that is, milliseconds later).  Of course, all this makes a disconnect from the actual instantaneous values of RPM and speed…but who cares?  We don’t really drive with the expectation to know our mph to three or four significant digits at every given instant during a huge acceleration.

This would cause needle to not move smoothly up but go down a bit, then up again then down again a bit before reaching it final position where rpm would settle.', 'The other smoothing is interpolating missing values between readings. In its basic form the needle controller has no idea what should be between two values, it just assumes needle must move from point A to point B and does this without any regard for how this actually looks (cosmetically). This then looks like jerky incremental movements (as seen in video). The solution must be something in line with controller delaying for one value so that it knows where next needle position will be in advance and then calculates the needed acceleration and speed. This way the controller knows not to decelerate if next value will not land in vicinity of previous value and just continue on, thus movement will look smooth.

Problem is, I don’t think you can even get it off if you can’t get that wheel off that you foamed up.  Gotta be able to pull the shaft out.

Something as simple as going to a tire shop .Thanks for sharing.If you are willing to do work yourself, take the tire off and inspect the tread. There may be a nail or screw stuck in the tire. If you don’t want to, maybe a friend will take the tire off and you two can inspect it together. Otherwise, take it to a mechanic or tire shop and see if it can be repaired. If it’s flat, you can put Fix-a-Flat or another tire repair liquid in it and then take it to a repair shop. If you use Fix-a-Flat, the tire needs it be deflated before you add it. We did that in a very slow leak on a rarely used car. The tire was flat, and after adding Fix-a-Flat the pressure was 17 psi.  Note that this method is temporary, and you really need to get it fixed or replaced. It’s only meant to get you to the tire store.Thank you all for the responses. This is not just one tire, it’s all the tires. The notice “low tires pressure” can pop up after only 6 days after adjusting the air in all tires to 32lbs. Other times it can be two to three weeks. Taken the auto back to dealer at least 6 times, the air is adjusted and then the pressure notice pops up within a couple weeks. In fact one tire in July flattened out, The dealer was near by, and even before he put the auto on the lift, he checked to see if he had a replacement. He then came back and stated there was a nail in the sidewall of the tire. I believe the auto tech banged a nail in the sidewall, in order to not blame the failure to the real problem. Last week one tire was 27, one 31 and both back tires were 30 after one week of adjusting the air to 32. I have informed the Honda Corp. they suggested to go to another Honda dealer for their opinion.

Panicking, I get out of the truck, take off my snappy winter cap and try to pound out the flames.  Then I notice my mother-in-law, still strapped in the passenger?s seat, trying to get out of the truck.  I drop my cap (which is now also on fire), and haul tail over to the passenger side, rip open the door, take off her seat belt, and proceed to carry her (hopefully) a safe distance from the truck.

So I hightail it back to the truck, pull out the wheelchair, slap her in it, and race up the street!', 'By the time I can refocus on the truck, Mr. Samaritan doused the fire.

Orlando Florida, 1986. I just bought a 1979 MG Midget from my landlord. The coolest little car ever. I decided to take a 30 mile solo trip to the beach to celebrate my new purchase. I drove it to Canaveral National Seashore, my favorite spot. Beautiful clear day, top down. I was in heaven. While at the beach, I decided to take a walk and left my belongings unattended. Upon my return, I was horrified to find that someone had gone off with my stuff. Everything! My flip flops, t-shirt, Heineken beach umbrella, my shorts, (I was wearing a lime green Speedo swimsuit; which was allowed, because I was in shape and in my early 20’s, and it was the 1980’s.) Luckily, I had my wallet & car keys in my car and was able to drive home. But here is where the nightmare begins. Half way home, on busy highway 50, I got a flat. I had a spare, but the road was   unbearably hot. I had no flip flops, no beach towel, no shorts or shirt. Just me & my lime green Speedos. I had to do something. Searching around, I found a pair of Shiny black cowboy boots behind the passenger seat. (probably belonging to the previous owner, my landlord.) I put them on and began changing the tire. (Front driver’s side facing the road, of course!) People were honking horns and slowing down. Nobody stopped to help! I looked like a freak. Thank God it was in a time before cell phone cameras and the internet. I know it would have been a huge hit on YouTube to see a guy in lime green Speedos and black cowboy boots changing a tire on a busy highway.', 'To this day, every time I go to the beach, I keep a complete outfit in the trunk of my car and I no longer wear Speedos. I have surpassed the “Speedo limit”, if you will, which, in my opinion is 25.', 'Orlando from Orwell, VTMy dad was in the service so, my family traveled quite a bit between postings. We had plenty of bad road trip experiences, but probably the worst occurred while en route to Fort Huachuca, Ariz.', 'Dad was driving our Ambassador station wagon, packed with many belongings, Mom, the three boys, our dog – and the damn cat. We’d made it from Mississippi to the middle of the Arizona desert virtually crisis free, when a monsoon-like rainstorm opened up. Sheets of rain pelted the car, making it almost impossible to see.', 'Then, the cat began to howl. At first, we thought he was just scared. But, on closer examination, his body language made it clear that he had to go – and the launch window was going to be measured in seconds, not the several minutes that it would obviously take for the storm to pass.', 'There was only one solution: Someone would have to hold a litter box while Thomas took care of business. Guess who? Why, Mom, of course! She quickly snatched a box, filled it with litter and positioned it under the cat as he made his deposit.', 'I have no idea what that cat had been eating, but what he produced could easily be classified as a weapon of mass destruction. And, there we were, trapped in the Ambassador, a torrent raging outside. Of course, our discomfort was only collateral damage. Mom took the bullet.Well.', 'At the time I was going to school in Erie, PA where we get lake effect snow and ice from October to April and everybody knew how to drive in bad weather.  Two alumni from the school were getting married and a bunch of us were bridesmaids/groomsmen in the wedding and we had to drive to Oklahoma where all of this was taking place.  It was January of 2007, and if you recall, a major ice storm was sweeping through Midwest.', 'We were an hour away from our destination when we got a call from the bride.  “Turn around.” she said, “the pastor’s flight is canceled, the resort for the wedding is closing down and we’re just going to get married in the courthouse today.”  We were already so close we told her we’d meet them at the courthouse, so we got there just before they closed for bad weather and our friends got married in jeans and printed tshirts that said “Joe the Groom” and \"Macy the Bride\"', 'All of that was great fun and exciting, we ate the rehearsal dinner and used it as the reception, we dressed up in our wedding finery and went driving around looking for a restaurant that was still open, and played Air Soft in the hotel hallways all night.  In the morning we packed up and headed back for PA, counting the cars that were stopped on the side of the road.  We were number 32.', 'In all of our laughing and mocking of the Midwesterners who knew nothing about driving in ice, the hood of our ancient Mercedes Benz froze over and blew the head gasket and we were stuck on the side of the road in Missouri.  Go figure.', 'We got towed to a Pep Boys in Springfield where we combed the phone books for churches who might take us in considering that we had no money.  Then one of the cashiers said she went to a college there and we could stay in the dorms there.', 'We spent the entire next day in the cafeteria trying to find the parts to fix the car, but nobody had them or if they did it would take weeks to get them.  We even tried calling around to see if anyone would buy the car for scraps to get us money to take a bus home.  The real problem was that even if we had money, they were declaring a National emergency and nothing was going in or out of Springfield at all.  We finally got another friend to drive the whole way down from St. Louis and take us to Erie, I think the guy that owned the car had his dad go get it from Michigan.  All in all, it was the most memorable wedding I’ve ever been to and absolutely the craziest road trip I’ve ever been on!', \"Beth from Gettysburg, PAMy husband, my 18 month old son and I were on the way home, home was Wyoming at the time, from his grandfather’s funeral in New Mexico. Our car at the time was a '77 Chevy Malibu, this beast was older than I was. We were students at UW and we were as broke as only married students can be. We have enough money to drive our gas guzzler down there and back. We were following my father in law, in a (slightly) newer car that had A/C, since it was August and I don’t do well in the heat, my son and I rode with him. My father in law is a true Wyoming cowboy and to pass the time on this long HOT drive, he was listening to his favorite music, yodeling. I tried to fake sleep, hoping he would turn it off, but nope, he started singing along with it. So I gave up on the fake sleep and tried to engage him in conversation. I was following our route on a map because at Moab, Utah, we were going to head back across Colorado, and he was going to go north to his home. We only had an inch on the map before I could escape the yodeling and get back to my own, quiet, sweltering car. As we continue on the road, Route 666 South, I swear I am not making that up, I notice that outside is getting drier and we have not yet hit a sign that says “Welcome to Utah.” I kept saying to my F-I-L, “We really should be there by now, we only had about 50 miles and we aren’t there, shouldn’t we stop and see where we are?” My father in law is just happy to have someone to listen to how much he has been practicing his yodeling. We finally, 3 hours later get to a town, and it isn’t Moab. We had missed a turn off and the ONLY reason we stopped was because the car got a flat. He would have been happy to continue, soon we would have needed passports. We stopped at a mechanic shop and heard the mechanic trying to explain to a customer that the alternator needed to be replaced because it was making too much electricity. So we finally get out of the car and my F-I-L notices that we were too far south, huh, maybe we missed the turn off. I am trying to control myself, when he says, “oh good! you can hear the other tapes I have!”, all yodeling. So not only do we have to continue listening, we took a 6 hour detour. We finally get to Moab, by this time we have been driving for 12 hours and we have another 10 to go. My poor son is about to lose his mind and we don’t have money for a hotel. My F-I-L waves goodbye and rides off into the sunset, literally singing, and we try to make it back home. We had to stop at about 2 AM because neither one of us could see straight anymore and we slept for about and hour and finally got home. It took almost a week before we could get my son to get back into the car, and I truly believe that there will be yodeling in hell.Hi:  I have many road trips from hell but this one is by far the worst.  In June 08, I took my Rav4 to the dealer to get a tuneup for a road trip to Pa. I live in Tennessee. At this time, they removed the passenger side air filter from behind the glove box and found 3 small baby mice and a mother mouse.  I must add that when I was driving to the dealer, I looked down and saw a mouse walking on the floor passenger side.  I screeched to the side of the road but, of course, I could not find the mouse.  So they put the baby mice in the field and literally tore my car apart trying to find mom.  They assured me that they had.  Yea, right.  I arrived in PA and the weather was cool.  In one day it was in the 90’s.  I opened the car door and the smell was absolutely awful.  I took apart the filter but could not find the mouse.  My sister and I had many trips planned so we had to ride with the windows down in the heat with her holding a burning incense stick.  This went on for a week.  I have a carcazized skeleton in my cooling and heating system that someday maybe found by auto archeologists.Submitting my story: 30 Hours of Hell, the tale of how, 14 years ago, I drove from South Carolina to New York City on a moment’s whim, alone and without true directions.\", 'It was… an interesting journey.My wife and I, and our three young children, were taking a trip through West Virginia in our 1973 Volvo pulling a small tent trailer. The mountains were not steep, so the road was straight down the mountain and straight up the next mountain. I coasted down the mountain, then at the bottom of the valley, I shifted into a lower hear and floored the accelerator to start our long path up the mountain in front of us. I soon noticed that there was no resistance when pressing on the accelerator. In fact, when I put my shoe beneath the accelerator, I could lift it, and then it would flop back to the floorboard. What? How could this be?! I tried that again, with the same results. Obviously the accelerator was not attached to the engine. Oh oh. The engine was at full throttle, so I couldn?t put in the clutch to shift, or the engine would blow up. Luckily for us, the steepness of the mountain was perfect, so the car neither gained speed nor slowed down. Here we were, in the middle of nowhere, riding in a run-away car. Now what? I knew that when we finally stopped, I had to shut off the engine and coast to a stop, without shifting gears and without being able to restart the engine if we stopped with part of the car or trailer on the roadway.', 'God was with us. As we were going up the mountain wondering where we could pull off the road, a road-side fruit and vegetable stand appeared on our side of the road. I tried hard to gage the speed and momentum of the car and trailer, and then at the appropriate time, I turned off the engine and coasted into the small space in front of the fruit stand, where, fortunately, there were no other cars.', 'The only toilet was an outhouse, and there was no running water. After my wife and children used the outhouse, my wife bought bananas, thinking that by peeling the bananas, this would be the cleanest fruit at the stand.', 'When I looked under the hood, and then under the dashboard, I found the accelerator cable had broken where it entered a metal tube through the firewall. The broken end of the multi-strand cable was frayed, so it stuck in the metal tube. We were in the middle of nowhere, so the monkey was on my back to fix this problem. I looked in the trunk, where I keep tools and some items in case of an emergency (this incident qualified). I found a new roll of picture hanging multi-strand wire that happened to be about the same diameter as the accelerator cable. I pulled out the broken cable and inserted the picture hanging cable into the metal tube and through the firewall. I tied the new cable around the appropriate link beneath the air cleaner, and the other end was tied to a hole at the back of the accelerator pedal.', 'It worked! The engine started and the speed could be controlled. After thanking the owners of the fruit and vegetable stand for the use of their facilities, we continued up the mountain. The next day we passed a Volvo dealer where I purchased a new cable. The Volvo dealer?s service department couldn?t install our new cable until a week later, so we drove home to Minnesota with my fix, and then I installed the Volvo cable.', 'Keep a roll of picture hanging multi-strand wire in your car?s trunk!Talk about a road trip gone bad, I have one for you.', 'We had arranged to spend some time in the Smokey Mountains and hike to a lodge at the top of Mount LaConte for an over night stay.  It was probably the hottest day of the summer when we left on our trip from Kalamazoo, Michigan.  We were driving a full size wagon and pulling a pop up camper.  We were half way between Fort Wayne, IN and Lima, OH when the first incident happened.  Steam start pouring out of the engine compartment.  Fortunately we were coming up on a rest area so I pulled in.  I knew immediately what was wrong and was mentally kicking myself in the posterior.  I knew we had a weak radiator hose and had meant to replace it before the trip.  But I got busy and forgot about it.  There was a pin hole leak in the hose right next to the connection.  I was able to cut the hose and re-clamp it.  After filling the radiator with water we were on our way again.  We stopped in Lima, OH to purchase a new hose and radiator fluid.', 'The second incident happened when we had just gotten on the express way in Lima.  A car pulled up next to us and mouthed the words “flat tire” and pointed to the trailer.  Fortunately we were just coming up on an exit so I pulled off the express way and into a vacant parking lot.  Sure enough the tire was flat.  I don’t think the tires had ever been off the camper so I struggled for a long time loosening the lug nuts.  Did I mention that the temperature was about 105 degrees in the shade.  After much struggling and some appropriate language I was able to replace the tire.  By now I was hot, and dirty and tired.  I asked my wife to drive so that I could get a little rest.', 'We had just past Dayton, OH when the third incident occurred.  I was dozing off when I felt a jolt that was more than just a bump in the road.  My wife yelled that we had been hit.  In a split second I realized that we were already spinning out of control so I yelled back “Hit the brakes”.  The car and trailer jack knifed, spun out of control and down a grassy embankment.  We were fortunate in that we did not hit anything on our way down the embankment and that the car stayed upright.  The only injury that occurred was when my wife’s legs hit the steering wheel.  The trailer came loose from the hitch and was lying on its side.  It had been totaled.  The person who had caused the accident had stopped by the side of the road.  He was drunk.  He had fallen asleep while driving and hit the corner of the trailer.', 'Even though a lot of bad things happened that day, the good news was that no one (my wife, nor our two boys nor me) suffered any serious injury.  We managed to settle the insurance claim on the trailer, get the wheels on the car repaired and continue on our journey to the Smoky Mountains.  We made good on our reservations at the lodge on Mount LaConte but had to forego the rest of the vacation.', 'That’s the story of our road trip gone bad.', 'Dave BarryWhen we were little New York kids, we drove from Long Island to St. Petersburg, FL every year. Both parents are from the south, and my Dad has an invisible friend named “Y’all.” We figured it was the stress of his job as an FBI man. Someone had evidently threatened his life just before this particular trip (circa 1963) and he took the threat very seriously. We were unaware of this, of course.', 'We were driving through the farm country- I think it was Pennsylvania, and the folks had given us each an egg of Silly Putty to keep us quiet (there were four of us kids.) Having copied comics, made funny shapes, we searched for a new use for the goop. We decided to blow bubbles with it. You flattened the gob over your mouth, and slowly blew on it trying to make a bubble. My sister was the first one to be successful. The sound that it made when it popped sounded exactly like the ricochet of a bullet. “BEEEEEUW!”  It was loud.', 'Thinking that someone was shooting at our non-air-conditioned, 1958 Ford Station Wagon (IN AUGUST!) my father screeched “Y’all get down!”  With that, he pulled off the road, and started barrelling through somebody’s field at about 90 miles per hour. My father had never raised his voice, and never broken the law that says you must keep your car out of fields. We were shocked. Once again, he screamed, “Y’all get down!”  With that second demand, we figured that if Y’all was supposed to get down, we’d better get down, too.  We all dropped down, and got in the bottom of the car, in front of the backseat.  We were terrified, and figured that he had gone insane because of the pressures of the job. My mother was hollering, we were screaming, yet, Y’all had said nothing. One more bit of proof that Daddy REALLY needed this vacation.', 'Eventually, after barrelling through the field, which was like driving over a large washboard, we emerged on another road. Daddy had escaped the hail of bullets that he evidently expected.', 'It wasn’t until 30 years later that he found out that it was Silly Putty. By this time, we’d lived in Florida since 1967. We knew who y’all was. When we told him, his incredulous response was, \"That was Y’ALL???\"', 'I think that the trip marked him…First year after college my car was a 1970 VW Bus purchased in the rust belt Finger Lakes Region of NY state. How rusty was it? I got in one morning and it wouldn’t start. I walked to the back to look at the engine and saw the battery hanging from one wire having fallen through the rusted out compartment. Solution? A board. It  taught me how to work on engines (what was that book? How to keep your VW alive, a guide for the complete idiot?) and to use a pop riveter.', 'I was working at WGVA AM doing the morning news. I had to work a half day Christmas eve and got off Christmas day. My folks lived in Wilmington, DE - usually a six hour drive.  I left at 1pm and arrived in Wilmington at 11:30pm.', 'I drove through a blinding snow and ice storm.  The bus actually was a great snow car in terms of traction,  but I had a hole in the floor by the brake and gas and the fan moved hardly any air.  I remember taking off my winter coat and putting my feet through the arms to try and keep them warmer and until I got south of Scranton/Wilkes Barre I had to lean forward and peer out of the only section of windsheild I had - a softball sized clearing just above the defroster.', 'It was nice to see the fam for Christmas morning but had to leave in the afternoon of Christmas day to get back north and go to work the following morning.  The drive back was far easier but concentration required during the trip down was exhausting.It was a hot July weekend in North Platte, Nebraska. I was scheduled to attend my Army Reserve Drill the second weekend in July, 2000 in Omaha, NE 278 miles away. My two youngest children, ages 7 and 12 accompanied me as we left North Platte Thursday evening headed for the Missouri River near Yankton, SD, for a mini camp -out vacation in my 1985 VW Vanagon before driving to Omaha for my weekend drill on Friday.', 'We left North Platte early afternoon on Thursday and arrived at our campground near the beach at the Gavins Point Dam, 275 miles down the road, late that evening.', 'Waking the next morning, I noticed some fluid on the asphalt under the engine compartment that concerned me, however after enjoying the morning playing in the water on the banks of the Missouri river; we left for Vermillion, SD, about 25 miles away where I had attended college.25 years ago.', 'We were lucky to make it that 25 miles to Vermillion as I heard the familiar sound of my water pump going bad in my Vanagon.  Stuck in Vermillion, SD until I could get the water pump replaced I proceeded to retrieve my spare pump out of the back of the van and began to replace it. Unfortunately, the first bolt head on the pump broke and my DIY water pump project was history.', 'The nearest VW dealer was 60 miles away in Sioux Falls, SD where I had the Van towed with my children and me in the tow truck. Since I wasn?t going to make it to my weekend Army Reserve training, and had 3 days find a way home for myself and two young children. A one-way car rental across state lines was not allowed, the ?Greyhound Bus? option was a multi-day event.', 'Then, I remembered the 57 Chevy on E-bay that had looked at the previous week that was located in Mankato, Minn. There were no bids and I inquired about the vehicle and the beautiful ?Dusk pearl?, 4-dr that was built in Wisconsin. They seemed to be willing to deal a little on the reserve price listed on E-bay so I thought to myself, this was our  ride home.', 'Now, how do I get myself and two children to Mankato by Saturday to test drive the car and pay for the car. Complaining to a substitute Taxi Driver in Sioux Falls after dropping off my Vanagon at the VW dealer, about the rental car restrictions he said, he?d call dispatch and see if he could take us to Mankato, Minnesota, 175 miles away. Dispatch said no problem as long as I paid cash and I gave him the $175.00 cash (nearly everything I had) for the one-way fare and we were off on another adventure', 'Arriving in Mankato, late that night and while en-route finding a motel room next to the dealership with only one room left due to a local softball tournament. The room was over $100 but it was one of the last left in town and we were exhausted from all of the traveling that day; I gave the motel my credit card number just as my cell phone battery died in the Taxi en route to Mankato, Minn.', 'The next morning I inspected and test drove the 57 chevy while the kids slept in the Motel across the street.  The car was much nicer than the pictures on E-bay revealed, all stock, matching numbers and better than I wanted for my ?daily driver?. But, it was our only ticket home that weekend.', 'By 11 am the paperwork at the dealership was done and I drove the car across the street to the motel. The kids were still sleeping. I woke them up and by noon we were on our way back home, a two-day drive', 'The kids saw the car as we walked out to the parking lot. They exclaimed, ?Dad, look at the cool car over there?, not knowing that it was the car we were using to get home that weekend. We walked over to the car, I opened the door, put the key in the ignition and said, ?lets go, it?s our ?cool car?', 'Never having owned a 57 Chevrolet, I encountered my first dilemma at the gas station across the street where I decided to fill up before leaving Mankato. Embarrassed at not being able to find the gas cap, I asked my 12 year old to get the original owners manual out of the glove box and find out where the ?gas? goes. The problem was solved by the owner?s manual. We were on our way home.', 'That was nine years ago and nearly 55,000 miles later and my 12 year-old son is now the primary driver of the vehicle that gets used every week and has never seen the inside of a garage, even while I spent most of 2007 in Baghdad, Iraq, interrupting my garage building project that is almost finished. Our highway adventure will come full circle in 2010 when I drive the 57 Chevy into a garage for the first time.My husband and I took a trip to the Southwest in 1978 in a 72 Chevy Impala that had about 84,000 miles on it.  Before the trip we had the car serviced for the trip and bought four new tires for it.  All went well until we arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  In pulling into the motel, the muffler fell off.  Next day it was replaced.  We arrived in Albuquerque ane the air conditioner had to be fixed.  One of the tires developed a bulge in Gallop, NM requiring a new tire.  We toured the canyons and had started to return to Pittsburgh via Colorado.  In Pueblo the engine quit due to a rocker arm failure.  It was replaced. In the middle of Iowa on a Saturday late afternoon two more rocker arms blew.  A great mechanic came in on Sunday and replaced them just so we could continue our trip.  In Dayton, Ohio another tire blew…it seems that all the new tires were defective.  We were lucky in many ways because service places were all around when the trouble happened and not in the desolate canyon environs.I’ve taken 3 road trips from Indiana heading west.  The idea was to take state roads to see the country.  Each had their issues:', '#1) Passengers were mother and 2 boys (9 and 11).  I did not have a DVD player and each had to have their own seat so they couldn’t “touch each other”.  My suburban has a 42 gallon gas tank and both boys panicked in the desert when the gas tank was under 1/4 tank.  I just laughed.  I was pointing out the mountains and splended scenary and the boys just talked about trucks on the highway.  After a while the boys needed to get their “energy” released.  A small park was found and I stopped and told them to run it out.  Apparently their energy was gone because they didn’t want to.  I needed time away from them.', '#2)  Moral…do not travel 5000 miles with a 16 year old boy when his girl friend is still in Indiana.  Luckily a cell phone was available and the bill had 2 sheets of logged calls.  Secondly, when the air conditioner compressor freezes when it is engaged, removed the power so when a rain storm creates fog on the windows turning the defroster on, the fan belt is not burnt up by the air conditioner compressor while parked in a rest area in the middle of the only 2 towns in North Dakota.', '#3  Thinking a Jeep Wrangler would be nice to drive west, not thinking much about the 12 gallon gas tank.  There is a highway 12 in Idaho where a sign indicates that the next gas station is 72 miles down the road.  I looked at the gas gage and quessed that there would be enough gas, I went on.  72 miles and winding mountainous roads later caused a panick on the gas supply front.  Finally, a town appeared and gas was purchased at the mountain lion and bear check station.  Highway 101 down the Oregon coast is beautiful, until someone pulls out into your lane and waiting (which seemed like an eternity) for the sound of vehicles touching.  25 foot skid marks later the nerves are gone.  The Jeep was not touched…dinner was needed.', 'There are no more road trips planned at this time!!!']\n",

You have a short somewhere between the fuse box and the instrument cluster. You’ll need someone who is experienced with a multimeter and armed with a schematic diagram to track this down.If you want to try and fix this yourself you should invest in a factory service manual for the wiring of the car. Ebay is a good place to get one. It will show you all the accessories the fuse ties to. Check the cigarette lighter socket to see if it is shorted. One way to help you find the short is to replace the fuse with something like a brake light bulb. It will limit the current going to the short to a safe limit on the wiring. The short will make the bulb glow brightly. You then start removing suspected loads that may be causing the trouble. When you disconnect the wiring that has the short on it the light will dim or go out completely depending if there is another current path to ground or not.']\n",

The fluid hasn’t been changed or flushed. My question is should I change the transmission fluid or should I keep it how it is? I did take it to a shop and the mechanic said the fluid level was fine, but he found little metal particles in the fluid which doesn’t sound good to me. I have heard a few stories about people who had slipping tranies on their car/truck, and days after changing the fluid the transmission died. Is this true? have y’all heard anything similar?

Always do a “drain and fill” which means remove the pan, replace the filter and gasket, and then refill with new transmission fluid of the proper type.  It is normal to find some metal shavings in the transmission pan of a high mileage transmission.  Changing the fluid cannot hurt, and may help.  This, of course, assumes that the correct type of transmission fluid is used, and that it is refilled to the proper level–use of the incorrect fluid, or being low on transmission fluid can cause slippage/delayed engagement.Is the transmission fluid level low?

However I’m still kind of a newbie, what exactly do you mean by regular servicing? Is it just getting the fluid and filter changed or is there more to it than that?If you pour in a bottle of Lucas transmission additive you might get a few more weeks or months before it folds up. But folding up seems a certainty in the near future. That additive drastically improves the friction in the clutches which are just about shot.It’s 10 yrs old. Miles? Original owner?

The cap is shaped like a hat and has the Chevy bow tie in its center.  The cap is held on by 6 black bolt looking covers that screw over the outside threads of the lug nuts.  The black bolt looking covers are part of the cap, they’re molded into it and can’t individually be removed.  They’re also plastic and they’re absolute crap.', 'Bought the truck new and all was well until around 06 or 07 I started noticing how those black bolt looking covers would be loose.

A sharp turn at a high speed and all but one or two will come loose by the time I get to where I’m going.  On a couple of occasions I’ve lost the cap completely.  It happened once while going through a round-about at normal speed.  It popped off and rolled across the asphault and up onto the sidewalk.', 'To stop this, I’ve had all the lug nuts replaced last year because their outside threads were corroded and worn down after 11 years.  I also replaced a couple of the caps since getting the new lug nuts and still those come loose too.  I keep a socket wrench in the truck to occasionally tighten them up and by occassionally I mean two to three times a week.  Sometimes I can tighten them, sometimes they just won’t go back on.  It would seem that after new lug nuts and a couple of new caps with brand new black covers, that the problem is bigger than just those things… maybe the wheel itself is the problem?', 'What to do?', 'Initial thought was to just buy a different model set of wheels from GM for that same era.  Dealership says that all the GM products for that truck in that size wheel will involve the use of those plastic black covers that will either keep a flat cap or hat cap over the lug nuts. Maybe that would be ok for another few years???  Also tried National Tire and Battery but wasn’t impressed with what they said to check out on their website with their wheel visualization program.  They all look too flashy, too sporty, or too low rider’ish for a straight-forward, Mom and apple pie no frills pick up truck.  Have also wondered if it could be an alignment issue or could it be something that could be cured if there were longer lug nuts with outside threads that would stick out a little further thereby making more, deeper contact with the center cap.  It would also allow the center cap to “float” a little above the wheel cover and not be pushed by the wheel until it pops or loosens.', 'Any thoughts? Thanks.chrome wheel common problem for chev. the simplest fix is to hold center tight to wheel and scribe around with marker. grind the center down. use non hardening permatex to secure nut threads. the problem is center of chrome warps outward after 4 or five years age.I have the same exact truck, in “work truck” trim.  The decorative hubcaps are not the problem.  The problem is that someone is overtorquing the plastic nuts, causing them to split or strip out, so they won’t properly tighten to the actual lug nuts on the wheels.', 'You can buy a set of 4 new genuine Chevrolet decorative hubcaps online for less than what the dealer charges–I think I paid about $60 with free shipping.  If you don’t care about the Chevrolet logo, there is a version where the center is just a glossy black circle, for about $40 with free shipping.  Just be careful to use a nutdriver when tightening the plastic nuts, and don’t overtorque them.I found that the problem is the plastic cap is barely attached to the wheel nut by only 2 turns.  So to repair this first make sure the plastic caps are in good shape and replace them if stripped or cracked.  Next take the center caps off the truck ( you might have to remove all the plastic caps) and shave 1/4 inch off the back of the center cap where it touches the wheel.  I used a small cutoff wheel on a dremel tool, wear eye and ear protection because it gets loud and there will be a lot of plastic flying around.  Put some sandpaper down on a table and sand the center caps flat and trim any bits off to clean it up.  Now put everything back together and reinstall on truck, carefully screw the plastic caps back on all the way.  No one will notice the modification and they will not pop off at highway speeds.']\n",

Given the vehicle’s age and how relatively few Mitsubishis are out there in terms of used engines, etc. it’s probably not worth fixing.

      "['Hi all. I wanted to provide as much info as possible, so this ended up being a long post. I’m feeling really stuck and can’t “take it into the shop” in the traditional sense, so I deeply appreciate you if you make it to the end.', 'We have a 2016 Jeep Renegade Limited with just under 25k miles. I’m in Alaska and don’t live on the road system - it came on a cargo plane. We do have an auto shop here that sometimes has a mechanic, but there is not one there now and it could be months or more until we have one again. That being said, I do know a few people that are much handier than I am and could help with many things…my own knowledge on the other hand is pretty limited. We bought the car in July and it’s been great until now. We bought it at a dealership but actually had a chance to get in touch with the previous owner, and she said there were no issues she was aware of, she just wanted something different.', 'So onto the problem… a few weeks ago the engine wouldn’t turn over. Luckily I have an ODBII scanner and plugged it in. It gave me the P0340 and P0335 codes for the camshaft sensor and crankshaft sensor. I ordered them both, waited, and discovered that the camshaft sensor was the wrong one and didn’t fit. I replaced the crankshaft sensor and it started right away! It felt pretty good to be able to fix it.', 'Fast forward about 4 days, and it wouldn’t start again. I plugged in the ODBII scanner, and no codes at all this time. I unplugged the battery for about 20-30 minutes to reset the computer, and still had the same issue - no turning over and no codes. I decided to order the correct camshaft sensor. It arrived today, I replaced the old one, and it didn’t change anything. No turning over and a check engine light with no codes.', 'Another thing to mention is that before I replaced either sensor, the check engine light would turn on, blink for a little, and then go back to solid. After I got it going the first time (with replacing just the crankshaft sensor), there was no check engine light at all until it stopped turning over again. At this point it is doing the same thing as before: solid, blinks a little, solid. This is obviously with just having the car on, not fully started. I know a blinking light can mean a misfire, but I’m not sure how to determine that or what is causing it, especially since it was fine for a few days.', 'A few other things that may be worth mentioning…It’s already below freezing here, but I do have a block heater. I also have a trickle charger that has been able to charge up the battery no problem. A few weeks before the issue started, there was some gurgling from the muffler. My friend said it was likely the water byproduct in the catalytic converter and that it hadn’t gotten hot enough for it all to evaporate. Drives tend to be shorter here - maybe as short as 5 minutes total, plus warmup time. It’s a small village but big enough for tons of folks to have a car here.

Sometimes it seems to snap out of it completely, and then other times it’s pretty persistent. The van definitely has a rough idle from time to time, to the point where it will die on me. Sometimes after reversing, sometimes after sitting for a while. I’m wondering if possibly fuel injectors might need to be cleaned or even replaced. The van is nearing 300,000 miles with mostly original parts because it wasn’t taken care of too well by the former owners. I just changed the alternator and battery in it. I’ve done a small tune up on it as well. New cap and rotor, new spark plugs and wires, new fuel filter, new air filter, new PCV valve, and I had to put an oil sending unit on it as well. Any guesses what might be going on? I’ve also considered that maybe it’s a timing issue and that it needs a timing kit? I’ve always heard though that typically timing chain issues just get worse and worse, not back and forth, which is what this is doing. Hopefully the people here can give me a few options to get to the bottom of this.

It was sitting on the back of the seat, seat was down, hit the brakes hard, tipped it over, then when I moved it I put it on the seat, and took it back to the store, stupid stupid. It was in a plastic bag, but… long story short, acid got on the seat of my car, seems like maybe it went through the back of the seat, and it ate through the seat. I got it all repaired at the dealer… but they did not change out the seat belt buckle, so that is still damaged and I just don’t know if I trust that they got everything and cleaned it all out. I had put some baking soda on the new seat and on the seat belt buckle, I don’t think I put baking soda on it at the time when it was burnt up, I just tried not to drive my car much but had to wait like 2-3 weeks until I could turn it in to be repaired, I just didn’t know what I was doing, ugh I wish it never happened… I am just worried -  is there still acid in my car, could I be breathing it in , etc. I want to get it detailed and cleaned, but don’t want to spend the money. I looked under the seat and there is some rusty looking areas, and I can see the baking soda I had put down there I believe. Can’t upload the photos for some reason.We all have had accidents. Tipped over the battery in my boat, and it spewed acid everywhere. Hands pants shirt boat floor etc. I used baking soda on my hands and everywhere,  my clothes were fine and no issues for anything, 15 years later the boat floor is fine, I had sunglasses on, but I loose them faster than doans has pills. I am not saying anything except that it did not turn into the disaster I was expecting.It’s almost certain there isn’t any acid in your car anymore. If it were still there in a concentration that could harm you, you’d have already experienced symptoms. As to the seat belt buckle, it’s probably fine. The plastic shroud on the outside is just cosmetic. The important stuff is inside and it’s made mostly of metal. If you’re really worried, just find the same kind of car that you drive in a junk yard and get the seat belt buckle from it.']\n",

The manual just refers me to a dealer. I don’t think I have a disc stuck.

Thanks for your help!Is this car still covered by warranty?', 'Are you using a burnt disc . . . in other words one that you copied yourself?Not really clear whether it is a DVD or CD here, but does it do it with all discs or some.

Not much can be done to repair these units nowadays.', 'I see @db4690 beat me I would not imagine it is anything to do with a fuse, I would rather think it is about your disks or maybe some dirt on the drive lens', 'if you “burn your own disks”: consider using another brand of the blanks, for example Memorex tends to have lower quality than Verbatim, another thing to try is to buy dedicated “musical blanks”, they definitely work better in picky drives', 'I would not imagine dirt to be the factor in relatively new 2014 drive, but after years in service I would disassemble the drive and CAREFULLY blow lens with air and make sure grease is not old/thicken on the slidesThanks, I believe we are out of warranty though I’ll double-check.

I might try gently blowing it out with some canned ‘air’.  If it gets no power when the key is off I wouldn’t worry about the fuse.I’ve fixed that “bad disc”  problem on home dvd players by taking them apart and cleaning the lens with a q-tip and alcohol, and lubing the two slides with a tiny dab of white lithium grease.  My experience with this procedure is it usually works, but only for about 6 weeks, then the same problem re-occurs.  The ultimate cause seems to be the two drive motors themselves just wear out with use & get a little balky.  One drive motor  spins the disk, and the other moves the laser head in and out to follow the tracks.  Those seem to be just simple dc motors, and  the commutator probably starts to fail with high resistance, segment by segment.  Causes the dvd player computer to get confused about where the laser is pointed,  because it commands the motor to move, but it doesn’t move smoothly like it should.  That’s probably what causes all the noise, it is trying desperately to figure out where the laser is pointing, moving things here and there.    It’s sort of surprising, but from what I could figure out by inspecting the mechanism,  the only way the dvd computer knows where the laser is pointing is by examining the signal returns it gets from the disc itself; that seems to be the way they are designed, so they can be priced so low.   You get one heck of a lot of sophisticated optical  technology for $35 these days.', 'One caution, never take it upon yourself to take apart dvd or cd players or dvd/cd burners or anything containing a laser unless you understand the necessary safety precautions for working with lasers, as eye damage is possible from the bright lasers these products use.', '', '', ' GeorgeSanJose:', '', 'I’ve fixed that “bad disc”  problem on home dvd players by taking them apart and cleaning the lens with a q-tip and alcohol, and lubing the two slides with a tiny dab of white lithium grease.

I would just walk away from a damaged vehicle because that tells me that might be other things that you did not fix.Ask your asking price and say if you want this fixed it will be this estimate from repair shop additional, or you can take it as is and have it repaired on your own dime. It can get messy, I would go for as is.This is a 15 year old car.  A very rough search shows a selling price of $500 to $2,500.

I think it depends on the buyer and whether they want a pristine car and are willing to pay, or they want a good price and can live with the damage.  I can’t imagine spending that kind of money though just to sell it private.  If it were mine, I’d just fix it myself for $50, but forget paying someone to do it, IMHO anyway.Just buying a sprayer is almost $50 + primer,paint and clear coat it probably will be $150 atleast when I checked, it was around that price. But would be happy to know where you buy that cheap paint. My bumper has a lot of cracks so that is why it is kind of expensive. $250 paint and $150 bumper + possible taxes.Another vote for “save your money and sell it as-is”.  You will pay way more to fix this than the difference in value between selling it as-is, or selling it with this minor cosmetic damage repaired.  This is a $1500 to $2500 car depending on mileage and overall condition.  It is not new enough, nor valuable enough to justify spending money for bodywork prior to selling it.Not counting the $90 or so for a aftermarket rear bumper that you still have to paint, salvage yards want more than that for a bumper cover in decent shape.People are going to knock your price with visible flaws, it is part of negotiating.

      "['Hi, does anyone have any ideas on this. My 2003 Honda Accord radio will turn on while the car keys are not in the car. It’s been happening for months now.  If I leave the radio powered on while the car is off it will drain the battery by the time I try to start it again in the morning.  If I turn the radio off before the car keys are out I can still see the radio receiving power (the clock on the display lights up).', 'I had a different issue about a year ago where if the radio was on it would make really loud popping noise then go silent. I could usually get it back by turning it of an on several times. I  it to a car audio shop who soldered the connections in the radio and I haven’t had the problem since. After this I also had an iPod/iPhone adapter installed. It seems as though the issue with the radio staying on may have started somewhere around that time.', 'Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?  The guy at the car audio shop says that he thinks the radio is just bad and that Honda had a huge problem with radios in Accords from that year.  However I don’t want to spend money to put a new radio in only to have the same issue after.  Can anyone help??I’m in agreement with the “guy at the car audio shop.” A new radio will fix your problem. Just make sure your new radio will connect directly to your original radio wiring. No cutting…no splicing.I agree with “missileman” go talk with the people at the car audio shop i feel you will get a better install from them. check out Cruchtfield’s web site and see whats out there and what  features you want, spend some time playi ng with the units on display make sure your ok  with the controlsI agree with the new audio unit. I’d like to suggest that if you do the job yourself you get an “adapter plug” from an automotive audio store. The plug gets spliced to the new unit’s wires on the kitchen table and plugs directly into your cars original wiring harness. It prevents the problems often associated with butchering the harness. I’ve done a few and they’re super easy.I would suggest a new radio is not going to fix this problem.  That is because a radio is not alive; and has no brains.  It does not know if the key is in the ignition or not.  If it is receiving power - the radio is capable of turning ON.  Just press the power button.  If no power is going to the radio - it will not turn on - no matter how many times you press the power button.', 'From your description - the ignition key is not shutting off available power to the radio unit.  A miswire or some such exists with the current radio and its wiring harness.  Insulation gone touching metal - allowing power to flow; or the power wire being hooked up to an always hot connection; etc.  You can get the setup wiring manual for your radio online.  You should have a service manual for your vehicle as well.  With these two items and some detective work - you can fix your problem.  (unless the ignition switch is defective)  If you install a new radio yourself - you will still have to figure all of this out… So if you like the current radio - figure it out with this one.I tend to agree with DS77, with the caveat that it is possible, though unlikely, that somehow the switched power side of the radio has become linked to the constant power side internally through some means (something metallic falling into the radio in just the right spot, or perhaps an impressive case of tin whiskers). This should be easy to test - unplug the radio, stick a multimeter on the switched power wire of the cable that you unplugged, and see if any power is going to it. If it is, then your radio is not to blame, and you need to look more in the area of your ignition switch.I expect at some point someone has made a wiring modification which wired the radio to the “hot at all times” point rather than the “hot in ON” point in the electrical system.  There’s probably a reason they did it this way.  Or they made a mistake and connected the wire used to provide power to the radio memory and clock to the radio itself.  In any event,  if this is the case, then you’ll just have to remember to turn the radio off when you exit the car.', 'The other possibility if the wiring remains as when the car was new is a sticking relay somewhere.  Most cars have a relay or relay that turn on when the key is in the “on” position.  And power to the stuff that is supposed to be powered when the key is “on” goes through that relay.  If that relay sticks on, that would explain the radio staying on.', 'A faulty ignition key switch is another possibility, among others.  An experienced auto electric expert could figure it out no problem I expect.IMHO, it depends on how the radio is being “fed” power.  Once car radios began to have digital displays and presets, typically there were two power connections to the radio–one for the main power, and one to “keep alive” the clock and memory presets.  When you turn off the key, the main power would die but the keep-alive connection would continue to provide a small amount of juice.  Often this connection would be fed from the same always-on power feed that fed the lighter socket or interior lights.', 'With increasingly complex stereo and nav systems, this may no longer be the case–it may be the system ALWAYS has power available and either its internal logic or the car’s “body controller module” (or both) may determine whether the radio should be on or not.  If the car allows you to keep listening to the radio with the key off until you open a door, it may be set up like this.', 'In the former case, I would suspect either someone made a mistake when modifying the wiring to add your i-stuff adapter, or the head unit has a fault.', 'In the latter, it could be the head unit or the car’s BCM.  And it could still be any wiring modifications that were botched.', 'The way I would approach this personally would be to first check or have checked the mods that were done to add your adapter, maybe removing it for troubleshooting.  If all appears well there, I’d replace the head unit next.Like Oblivion was saying, your vehicle may have a way to bypass power to the radio while the key is off. In my van, power to the radio stays on while the ignition is off for a short time at least and then automatically cuts off when opening a door or times out by itself. I would suspect some sort of power module or BCM is causing the trouble.Wow thanks for all the ideas and suggestions. I’m  actually going to try replacing the radio with an aftermarket one. I’ve seen as much information pointing to this being the problem as I’ve seen pointing to an issue with the car. Really praying this works. I will post an update as soon as I know the results.Replaced the radio today and so far so good. Hopefully it stays that waySo I want to understand the issue a bit more as to I maybe having the same issue. Which is where once the car (04 Honda Accord ex coupe) is off and key is out of the ignition the radio backlights stay on but radio doesn’t turn on at all. My fix for it was removing the radio fuse but obviously that’s not the fix I want. Any help or answers if it wasn’t answered already?.The person who had this problem 8 years ago in their last post said they replaced the entire radio to solve the problem.I read that part but I’m wondering if there was another solution to the issue or just thatWhat happens when you open the door after pulling the key from the ignition?']\n",

Your radio probably has some kind of volume indicator, a bar graph, or number. Mine briefly displays a number when the volume is changed. If that isn’t changing when volume of the radio changes then the problem, as you have guessed, probably isn’t with the main amplifier.Each component in your system has its own pre-amplifier. My guess, the pre-amplifier for the radio has gone glitchy.Car radios are 100% disposable, non-repairable, products…There are a number of places where you can send your defective radio into and have them fix it, though if it is just a standard unit it may not be cost effective to do that. More expensive units can be worth fixing, especially over the dealer cost of a new unit. The trouble you are having does sound like a problem inside the radio section and replacing it may be the best solution to the problem. Ebay is a good place to find original replacement units. That way all your external controls for the system will still work.Just make sure you get the security code for the new radio if you buy off ebay.  That and Craigs list is where stolen ones get dumped.I was considering replacing it anyways I guess. My only concern if it’s not within the radio, and it’s a problem with the antenna/connection… how can I diagnose this?', 'Thanks!You have to check the owner’s manual and see if your car is equipped with volume adjustment for speed and how to disable it. If you don’t have this option, then I would just change the radio with a decent aftermarket one.', 'Crutchfield has a lot of info and selection, with installation guides and accessories.You don’t have to be concerned about this trouble being external to the radio. A faulty antenna would be a different problem, like not picking up any stations. The trouble you describe has to do with the audio gain for the radio section, which is done inside the radio. If the external volume control  was a problem I would think the other functions would be effected also and not just the radio.The radio in my 98 Pathfinder did this. It was a known problem with all systems made by Clarion back then. So it may be the head unit.Alpine makes some of the best head units out there. that being said they also =have units that with an adp. that will let the remote radio controls work with your new radio. I have owned about 5 different Alpines over the years never one had any problems over the years. Cruthchfield does have a lot of good info. pay a visit to a local mobil electrincs store and talk to them. there our other brands out there that our very nice and won’t break the bank. when shopping also check out the instale bay at the store your thinking about doing bussenesss with, is it while lite, clean does the techs take pride in what they do? do they show the same care about changing the radio in your car vs.  doing a very large a/v system with all the bells.I have the EXACT same problem in my Prius V 2012.

These units are no longer made to be repaired, and even if it could be I doubt if you could find a repair shop to do it. If you did, it would probably cost a lot more to repair it than to replace the radio. You can buy a new unit  for the cost of one (perhaps two) hours of shop time.

There must also be some voltage level that can be measured when the car is not moving.  If that sensor input can be disconnected and the input is fed with that stationary voltage, you should be okay.  Just a thought.If it was related to the radio signal wouldn’t it be staticky instead of the volume dipping? But, since it only occurs when in motion then it makes me think there is noise interfering with the signal.  And, since satellite radio is fine then it’s specifically that wire.', 'The racks are mounted into the roof right where the radio wire runs, but since it is typically taped to the headliner the gap should have prevented damage.', 'Any advice is appreciated!Hello, this is a very old thread, but we are facing the same issue in our new MG RX5.

Good people on this site. Pretty soon I’ll stop as I’m in my 60’s. I get dizzy/nauseous under cars now laying on my back.Just for others who might have a Rav 4 (2013-2018) and I believe a Camry in that area which had the same engine/trans. I did my filter change yesterday. 65.1K miles. the bolts were so easy to get out (18 of them) except 2 at the curve in the pan farthest from the bumper. Those 2 had to be turned 4 or 5 times to get them to be loose whereas the others were able to be removed by hand after cracking. Those 2 were the only ones with Locktite (blue) on them??? For the one bolt behind that metal bar, I bought a 3/8\" wiggle/swivel adaptor but it’s still to big to get on the bolt head. I tried a 1/4\" 10mm 6 point with the screw driver attachment and it fit easily. Had to use the 1/4\" socket on the screwdriver for torque. The pan started to leak a lot when all bolts were loosened. I drained the fluid from the drain plug. 2.5 quarts normally comes out. Then the pan loosed up on it’s own and dropped off before the last 2 nuts were removed. When I put the  pan down, the gasket popped off on it’s own. It was really hard (like plastic from age/heat but I know it was rubber). No issues at all so far. Then I cleaned the pan which had some gray metal dust on 4 magnets and around them. The filter was removed (2 bolts) easily. It popped out when tugged on due to the rubber O-ring. About another 1.5 qts of fluid fell out.  It was clean inside but the filter paper was a tinge of gray. It did have a plastic mesh netting on the paper so I guess it doesn’t break free into the trans. It was a Denso OEM.  I bought a Beck Arnley filter from Rock Auto and it was just paper. The filter fit right in and I bolted it down. There is a wire harness that is just against the filter but I left it alone (don’t think it was under the 1st filter as it might get crushed).  I tightened the 2 bolts fairly snug with the 1/4\" drive. I put 4 bolts through the new gasket (rubber) to hold it against the pan. I put all 18 bolts back with the 1/4\" drive and snugged them 3X alternating on all sides. In total, almost 4 quarts came out (some spillage from the filter flow when pulled off). I added 3 3/4 quarts of super tech (LV / Mercon VI) and Valvoline Max Life. I used the same washers on the drain plug and fill hole as I’m going to drive it a few months and drop/fill with my std. 2.6 quarts fluid to get the fill amount close to normal from factory. It sat 4 hours and no leaks. This took me about 3 1/2 hours from start to finish. I drove it 0.5 mile and no leaks. I drove it 20 miles today and no leaks. I’ve done 3 other camrys trans filters (3 times each when owned 200K miles before trade in so I never had a leak on those).  Hope this helps anyone who might do one on a Rav 4 or camry.

What is the standard when it comes to brake line replacement?Brake lines can rot from the inside if the fluid is not changed on a regular basis as it should be or rust from the outside due to road salt, age, etc.', 'The reason for hesitancy about replacing everything at once is that mechanics are quite frequently accused of gouging and piling on.', 'For every customer who agrees with the notion of one bad/they’re all bad there are many more who will accuse the shop of gouging by recommending they all be replaced.', 'There is no standard. My opinion is that if one line is in bad shape the customer should be advised they all need replacement and that puts the ball on the customer’s side of the court.', 'This then leads to the point of brake lines being badly corroded to the point of failure and other parts which are likely on the edge.

I just got this car used from a reputable dealer 6 months ago.it’s only a 2002 Haundai Sonata without even 100,000 miles yet. I am in the northeast thoughEach brake line “lives” in a different environment.  You were the victim of bad luck, not a shoddy mechanic IMHO.At 13 years old in the northeast you can expect brake lines to start rusting out. It’s much more a time issue than a mileage issue.The better question is, “what is the standard for brake fluid replacement?” Most car makers recommend replacing the brake fluid every 2-3 years. Most owners ignore this recommendation, and as a result, brake fluid slowly absorbs moisture from the air and causes corrosion inside the brake lines. If your shop tested your brake fluid they would likely find it contains a high percentage of water from not being changed in the life of the car, I’d guess.', 'Your mechanic is not the problem. He was being cautious in not trying to replace too many parts and being accused of gouging.', 'The problem is you and/or previous owners not changing the brake fluid every 2-3 years as recommended by the manufacturer (check your owners manual).Since I haven’t had the car for a year I know it’s probably just dumb luck. I suppose I assumed too much when I thought the dealership handled everything about making the car up to snuff for passing the PA inspection and sale. I just wish the mechanic was honest and up front about what could happen and what might need done and let me decide as someone else pointed out earlier. It’s honest and avoids gouge accusationsBrake lines are mostly metal, with a section of rubber hose at each wheel.  The rubber section is needed to allow for the up and down movement of the suspension.  Most often it is a rubber section that fails.  The metal tube section last a lot longer.  Was you brake line failure at a fitting?  In a rubber section?  Or, in the metal tubing?', 'If one of the rubber sections failed, then other rubber sections are likely in similar bad shape.  The metal lines hold up OK if you change the brake fluid every 3 to 4 years.  If you never changed the brake fluid after 13 years the fluid likely has become polluted with water, and that water can rust the metal lines from the inside out.', 'More info about the specifics of what failed and where would get a better answer about what to do now.Those are very good questions for me to ask the mechanic. As I said the ONLY thing they told me was my rear break line was out the first time. I had to send it back to the same mechanic. Hopefully they’ll tell me straight what went wrong. Sometimes it’s about knowing what to ask. I’ll also talk to them and tell them to let me know ALL the details of everything that COULD be wrong so they don’t have to worry that I’ll accuse them of gouging. The shop’s not open til monday and they didn’t have time to get a look at it today.The problem for your mechanic is that all the corrosion is happening inside the brake lines where it’s invisible and impossible to inspect. All they can do is replace components. It’s your choice as to whether to pre-emptively replace parts that haven’t failed yet.', 'Since your mechanic used the word “corrosion,” I’m assuming that what failed was a metal brake line, not a rubber nose, since rubber doesn’t corrode.', 'Unfortunately no one can predict when a brake line will fail. It’s not the fault of your mechanics. But since you apparently have had two consecutive metal brake line failures (but be sure to confirm this with your mechanic first), I would have all other metal brake lines replaced, and all old brake fluid flushed and replaced with new fluid.I’m puzzled on how the OP can lose all brake pressure.  If a brake line begins leaking, then the car will lose only half the braking.', 'Sure the pedal travel will be farther to the floor and more pressure will need to be applied.  But it should not be the complete loss of braking the OP mentions.I have found that sometimes the “dual-braking” systems don’t really work that well.  On one car, when bleeding one caliper, the brake pedal always went to the floor.  I remember thinking, “Oh well, so much for the ‘dual-brakes’ myth.”Me too insightful, I never understood that.  The dual system is supposed to eliminate the total failure (I thought) but I’ve bled the brakes on my old Accord probably 50 times, same thing every time, just like you said.  Hmmmm.   RocketmanI just got done with the exact same problem with someones car. I replaced the line that went from the ABS actuator to the rear tee. The two lines from the tee to each rear wheel looked ok so I left them be.', 'When I went to vacuum bleed the brakes I kept getting a lot of air. I hopped in and pumped the brakes a few times and looked under the car. I had a gusher in the front left. I guess while I was replacing the rear main line, I had bumped a front line and caused a weak area to fracture without knowing it. I ended up replacing both front lines next.', 'The problem also is that many times these lines are hidden under or behind other parts and cannot be inspected. So the best a mechanic can do is to fix whatever is the problem at hand and try his best to inspect the rest.', 'As far as a mechanic being required to inspect and warn you of any impending doom. He’d have to advise you to replace the entire car. Because at some point something else will go wrong.', 'The OP only had the car for 6 months and the lines would have shown rusting at that point, but like I said …much is hidden from sight.', 'YosemiteEngineers love to design things to make them everything but easy to work on.  All automotive engineering students should have to spend an internship working in a garage.       RocketmanAgreed!!!', 'YosemiteNo sense getting all worked up yet, you don’t even know what the problem is. It could be the same line they “repaired” and it failed again. Imagine that. That would be far more concerning to me than another one leaking. These guys aren’t carnac the magnificent. As many have already said, few people want them to proactively fix at any cost even for something as critical as brakes. You tell them you want no failures, you better brace yourself for the ensuing bill. Because if one failed, the rest are surely not far behind…One line to the rear of my 1999 Honda Civic rusted through last winter. Two brake lines and two fuel lines run close and parallel from the firewall to near the gas tank; the whole bundle has a perforated plastic cover protecting things from flying debris. This cover, however, traps snow and ice and salt, etc. The repair shop said the least expensive way is to just run a new line outside that cover, but I decided to have them remove the cover for a closer look-see and to replace both rear brake lines.

Last time it made a knocking noise it was the cam bolts working themselves loose. I took the engine out again and completely rebuilt it and put it back in. It was fine for about 10-15 miles then it started making a sort of knocking again, with a stethoscope I could hear it pretty well from the timing cover but I also didn’t check the block as thoroughly as I should’ve.  I pulled the timing cover and the bolts are still in place and secure. Does anyone know what could be causing the knocking sound? Keep in mind that I’m 16 so there’s a very good chance I’m just really stupid and forgot to do something. The engine had weird studs for some of the mains and I had to use a wrench and hammer to try and get the same amount of torque on them as the rest of the mains.

Why do u think it’s rod knock?I didn’t properly torque 3 bolts on the mains, it had these studs that holds the windage tray or whatever that little tray was and I didn’t have a socket that could reach them, so I did the lazy and wrong thing and tried to “torque” them by counting turns and feel.

I got home and pulled the trouble codes which were P351a, p352b, p353c, and p354d.  I searched the internet and found this link, http://ricksfreeautorepairadvice.com/p0351-p0352-p0353-p0354- 2 p0355-p0356/, which seemed to indicate a grounding issue.  I pulled the dust cover off the engine and checked the connections to the coils and replaced the cover.  I cranked the car, cleared the codes and the car drove and reacted fine.  I took the car to the store 10 minutes later and got the loss of power again and shutter of the engine.  Still no engine light, but I plugged my scanner up again and got the same error codes.

Does leaving the AC on when you turn a car off cause problems in any way–particularly with the battery?I’ve been driving for 20+ years and have never turned the a/c off before shutting the motor down and never suffered any negative consequences as a result.  This is one of those old wives tales that get passes down from generation to generation.  Kind of like my grandmother used to keep the top of her console TV clean, would dust it several times a week because someone told her that the TV would ovwrheat and blow up if dust accumulated on the top of the cabinet.I cannot explain the reason for the dead battery but failing to turn off the A/C had nothing to do with it.', 'I too have your FIL’s habit of turning off all switches prior to shutting down the engine, but this habit comes from the olden days when you needed full battery power to start (especially in winter). Anyhoo, leaving accesory switches on overnight does not tax the battery at all. The electric power is controlled by the ignition switch. No ignition, no drain on battery.No related.  You can turn it off before or after turning to engine off or just leave it on.  Nothing will be harmed.  The Battery had other problems.  Make sure the charging system is checked before replacing the battery.Thanks for the confirmation of my thoughts, guys.', 'I think this is one of those things I’m going to keep to myself, for my own curiosity/informational purposes (I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong).  The “I told you so” is never safe.I would like to add a couple notes.  First, sometimes accessories are wired directly to the battery.  This is most likely to include the power outlets/cigarette lighter (depending on the model).  I also know people who wire their radios directly to the battery so they can play them without the keys.  So although I don’t see how the air conditioner could drain the battery, other electrical accessories can, in specific circumstances.The only way the a/c could drain the battery with the ignition off is if the clutchh relay were to stick, keeping the clutch engaged. But I doubt that’s what happened here.', 'Love your Everlasting Gobstoppers, BTW.So I made an account just to reply to this post cause I think this is very useful information, so I own a 2001 ford ranger and my ac only worked on max power. I then replaced the resistor and my ac started working just like new again, the resistor does exactly what the name suggests, it resists power coming to the blower motor which changes the speed of air blowing through your ac. In my truck it goes low, medium, high, and max. Also my ac only worked on max because the resistor has a failsafe on it which if the module breaks or fails then the batter then sends power directly to the blower motor, which is why there’s a max option and why it worked and all other ranges didn’t. Now just recently I would go outside and turn my truck on and it wouldn’t turn the starter motor, aka the engine wouldn’t start, but all my electronics would turn on including my ac and when I’d look at the battery gauge it would read at 1/4 battery power and when I’d look at the ac control it’d be on high (not max). Now I don’t believe my battery was draining while it was off, what I think is happening and could be the reason to this old wives’ tale is that when I would park my truck with the ac on, and specifically on the high setting (I’m unsure if the other modes apply yet and I doubt the max setting affects this at all), that puts an excess load on your battery, sure if the alternator is on it’s trying to charge the battery back up but since you have something “resisting” current, you’re technically still lowering the volts being recovered, so when you shut the vehicle off you already killed it from turning on again, I doubt this is an issue with new models of cars due to technological advances and less power needed to crank an engine. So I hope my story can help somebody out there, there’s always a method to the madness.When you turn the ignition switch to Off, the power to most of circuits, including the HVAC blower motor, is cut off.

I agree that minivans are versatile.  I have owned five minivans since 1991. However, there really isn’t much that can be done with the styling of minivans.

The auto repair shop used Napa parts which are OKAY with me, but when I compared the price the auto repair shop charged for the parts vs the Napaonline website, the auto shop was 40% higher.

You should have questioned the price before not after the repairs were completed.This is normal.  All shops do it.  And, while I haven’t checked into it, I imagine that the internet has forced Napa to cut it’s on-line prices to stay competitive, so that the repair shop may not get the substantial discount it used to, resulting in the large apparent markup.Yes, they did call with the price and I approved it. But the price provided was for the overall work, not a breakdown between labor and parts. Is this something that should be asked?', 'I understand that there is no recourse, I am just trying to understand the comment about the warranty. On the NAPA site, it states as long as the parts are installed by a Napa Auto Care Center, then the 12 month warranty applies. It does not state that I have to pay a different price.Thank you. It is interesting to note that the repair shop did state that they paid less for the parts than listed online. I am just trying to get my hands around this warranty thing…All parts are marked up for resale reletive to what what the SHOP paid for them. You did not buy your parts from napa , they did. And if they paid to napa the same price you could have they still will mark it up. Basic business practice.', 'Ford parts are marked up to reflect a 40% Retained Gross Profit and when outside parts are procured they are marked up only 30% r.g.p.', 'I don’t know what business you’re in nor how you make profit for your paycheck, but even if the dollars spent are high, no one stays in business at 0% retained profit.', 'DO NOT attempt to rebut that you could have got them for less elsewhere.

I must not have been very clear in my question and apologize for that, but I was really just trying to understand the warranty vs ‘list price’ vs ‘over the counter’ statement.Based on what you said, the parts warranty is there, per the NAPA site.  If there is a parts issue, then you may need to remind the mechanic that the warranty is still in effect, to gain the needed warranty satisfaction.  The labor warranty is whatever the shop’s policy is.  Sometimes it varies; some offer a strict 90 day warranty on all their repairs; others offer longer terms.just had new rotors and ceramic brake pads installed.', 'last week.the markup was 20%.', 'this paticular mechanic usually charges 30% mark up.heLast mechanic I used marked up the parts around 75%. Along with the $90/hr labor rate, I was paying him over $200/hr. I solved this problem by buying tools and a repair manual.That’s what I do when I have to have work done that is beyond my skill level. I’ve always had suspicion that some shops use cheap/inferior parts whenever they can and then mark them up to make a few extra bucks. My reasoning for this is that I’ve noticed that several shops that friends and family take their cars to for service will use no-name/genetic oil filters, plug wires, etc. Yet charge higher-than-you-might expect prices for them. On one invoice, a recall seeing a $7.95 charge for an oil filter (some generic brand) for a Crown Vic. At the time an OEM Motorcraft oil filter was going for around $3.50 at most parts stores before any discount.Realize on an oil filter charge it is all sort of made up for an oil change. Most places charge $24-$40 for an oil change. No matter what way you look at it, if the car is in for an oil change only the shop is not making any money. However they are getting a great opportunity to check vehicle and get potential work hopefully for mutual benefit.I think a mechanic is going to be a job that has the potential to make a lot of money in…When I was growing up…there were very very few kids I grew up with who didn’t know how to do a brake job, or even change a spark-plug and oil…Nowadays…MOST kids barely know how to open the hood…whats going to happen when they become adults???I’m not debating that at all. All I’m saying that some shops seem to use the cheapest parts they can find, but mark them up so much that they charge as much for higher quality parts that the customer could’ve bought himself. I had my Mustang in the shop to have some emissions part replaced, I forget what it was, but it was about 6 or 7 inches in length and mounted vertically in the engine, anyway it was pain to get to so I decided to have the Ford place handle it. At the time the car had about 75k on the clock so I decided to have them change the spark plugs while they were at it. The spark plugs on the 4.6L in a Mustang are nigh impossible to get to. I asked the service advisor how much extra it would be, he said that it would be $129.95 with the price of the plugs included. I already had the spark plugs with me, since my car has a supercharger and I need to use a colder spark plug for better drivability. I told him I already had the plugs, the price then dropped to $89.95 for the labor only. I don’t think a set of OEM Motorcraft spark plugs costs a Ford dealer $40. I know for a fact I can get a set of 8 at Advance Auto for about $25.Their profit that they pay for their meals and rent comes from labor, not from jacking up prices on parts. If I noticed a company doing this to me, and they have tried, I get them to lower it to something reasonable, or I pay the price and then send in a price gouging report to the state attorney general and any profit they would have thought they could make, would be spent on defending themselves from stealing from customers.Before you go on about the free market system and the American way, remember the American way is through a court room as well.Exactly Chris Truck I quoted out 3 shops for struts all the way around and front rotors and pads at no less that $1898 for my car last week, I went and picked up everything myself at Advanced auto with lifetime warranty installed everything myself in less than 3 hours total shopping and installing time for less than $450 total.

Now I had heard this statement or something similar years ago and had forgotten.', 'My question is how would this help or mask the symptoms a tired worn out engine?  All I can see it doing it plugging the oil pump pickup and locking up the engine?  I guess all this stuff could help plug leaks in gaskets/seals to mask an oil leak but what good would this really do?  Is this just an old saying or was this actually done at one time?  I can see it maybe working on an engine without an oil pump (really old) but cannot see it doing anything good, even in the very short term, on a modern engine.I know people who have added various additives to their engines that burned oil or had worn bearings and made more noise because of this.  They were mainly just thicker oil to mask the extra large clearances.  One issue with this in many modern cars is that the valve lifters and timing in many new cars requires a very specific range of viscosities as well as very clean oil.', 'I honestly feel that one of the main reasons you don’t see so many mass polluters driving around anymore is that modern engines cannot run in such poor condition because of all the sensors and hydraulic systems in the engine.  If an engine starts burning oil, it simply won’t run very long before something gets fouled.I think the sawdust and banana peels were for old worn manual transmissions, to cover up the sound of grinding gears, not for engines.  I remember an old (well, they’re all old) episode of the Andy Griffith Show where Barney thought he got a “great” deal on a used car, until it started acting up and they discovered sawdust in the transmission.This makes more sense than a pressure lubricated engine.', 'I recently had a manual transmission that was acting funny.  2nd gear synchro was shot and it would sometimes pop out of gear, especially 3rd, when you hit a bump and it was under load.

Andy advises caution and suggests that he have Wally the mechanic give the car a once over but Barney won’t hear of it. The old woman has him wrapped around her little finger so tight that he even overpays for the car. Not surprisingly, the car breaks down the next day when he take her out for the first time.

He only drove it that very short distance and traded it in.  Of course the dealer discovered it as soon as they sent the trade out for it’s first test drive, and subsequently dropped the pan again.  Of course that wasn’t a dealer trying to fleece a customer.I’ve heard that from other places in the '60s.

      "['I have a 2005 Honda CRV LX. I replaced my catalytic converter with an aftermarket one I found on Amazon (https://goo.gl/GTBnjD 36). The check engine light came on for the converter and I took it to a shop that confirmed it needed to be replaced. I had also been smelling fumes for some time which was probably due to the corroded connection at the back of the catalytic converter. And it was a little noisy. It came with a flex gasket for the manifold, but it didn’t fit. So I bought a better one from Autozone (https://goo.gl/cL4iAP 34). It seemed to fit well. The spring bolts came with the converter and installed without a problem. I also replaced the spark plugs (same NGK Laser Iridium that it had in it) and air filter while I was working on it.', 'When I started the car after I was done, it was much quieter while idling. Even while revving the engine in park, the exhaust sounded great. However, when I actually drove it, it was quite noisy while accelerating. Quiet while coasting. Only during accelerating did it make noise. I also don’t notice any exhaust fumes.', 'I’m stumped as to what the problem is. It sounds like an exhaust leak, but there are no other indications of a leak and it’s quiet as can be when the car is not in motion. Any thoughts?You might try checking for an exhaust leak the old fashioned way. Stick a potato in the exhaust pipe and start the car. Don’t rev the engine, just start it. If you hear a hissing sound and the engine is still running you do, indeed have an exhaust leak. I’d suggest the flex coupling between the engine and the cat as you may have finished it off when you replaced the cat or possibly the cat’s seal itself is a mis-match.', 'If the engine dies right away with no hiss, then there is no exhaust leak. Restart and rev engine and the potato should come shooting out the pipe. If that happens, the likely problem is that the cat you bought is not as good a muffler as the original equipment cat. You choices then are, ignore it, replace the muffler or add a additional bullet-style muffler between the cat and the muffler.Thanks!  I’ll give that a try.  There is no flex coupling per say.  There is a donut/flex gasket that fits over the manifold pipe and the flange of the cat is pressed against the gasket with two spring bolts.  The only thing I can think is that the springs are not stiff enough to keep the joint closed under the exhaust pressure when accelerating.  I assumed that revving the engine while in park would produce similar pressure to actually accelerating, but maybe not.', 'How much muffling does a cat provide?  Like I mentioned it’s much quieter than before at idle.  So I don’t think it’s the muffling ability of the cat itself.I have been thinking about this and I think the reason this is happening while accelerating and not revving the engine is because the noise is not he result of increased pressure due to higher RPMs.  Instead it’s caused by excessive rotation of the engine, leading to the flex joint (manifold to catalytic converter) opening more than it should.  My first thought is that it could be due to insufficient spring force.  The new springs may not have the necessary stiffness to hold the seal under load.  I may try adding some washers to compress the springs and increase the force.  I want to be careful not to increase it so much as to transfer the force further down the exhaust system where is it less able to tolerate the flex.', 'It also could be that the new bolts are a little longer, or the new gasket is not as deep.  Either way it would be the same solution: remove the excess slack from the connection.', 'It may be that the engine mounts need to be replaced, preventing the excessive twisting of the engine during acceleration.  I don’t know much about that, but imagine it’s more work than I’m willing to handle, or want to pay for.', 'A third possibility is that the donut gasket isn’t tight enough around the manifold down pipe, causing the flex in the connection to   open more than it would otherwise.  I am considering using a bit of Permatex 80335 Muffler and Tailpipe Sealer around the gasket to help seal it up around the downpipe.What did you do, any updates? I have a similar scenarioAlso,. My replacement cat is noisy.  All the pipes up to the actual muffler were replaced but now car is much noisier…I might try wrapping the cat,. No leaks that I seeWrap cat with insulating tape I’m thinking…There is a leak in the exhaust, or the muffler is bad.', \"It’s a pleasant surprise: how much good work an independent local muffler shop can do for a very reasonable price.Just to be clear: if I’m experiencing greater noise, then the noise itself is the only actual “problem”, right?  There’s nothing else to be concerned with?  I just noticed the added noise when coming home from getting government-mandated emissions testing (my '97 GMC Sonoma failed emissions a few days earlier which is why I got the new cat) and it passed, so would that indicate that there isn’t an exhaust leak?  Or if there is, that the leak isn’t reducing efficiency?If you have noise you might have a leak, or the replacement cat might just have less restriction so it is less of a muffler than factory. Unless you check for a leak, you won’t know which it is.\", 'And exhaust leaks can make you sick or kill you. That is why the outlet is far away from the passengers.']\n",

      "['First off, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all who have responded in the past to my posts seeking advice. I very much appreciate your efforts to help. I tried searching the internet for this condition but could not quite get the search wording right. In this case I am driving a 2005 Ford Escape V6, and when I am cruising at, say, 40mph, and I lift my foot from the gas pedal due to traffic conditions, when I depress the gas pedal again I get a thunk. If I depress it VERY slowly, no thunk, Also, no thunk when accelerating from a stop. Sometimes, but not always, I get a thunk when the transmission upshifts.', 'As I am writing this, CarTalk suggests this post, which is very close to what I am experiencing: Feeling a “bump” in the gas pedal after coasting…? 9', 'I changed the right front hydraulic motor mount right after I got this car about two months ago. Have only been driving it regular for about three weeks. Besides motor and transmission mounts, might there be anything else that could be causing this condition? Again, no thunk when taking off from a stop. This happens at faster and slower speeds than 40mph.', 'Thanks,', 'JackI would say u joints are a possibility, but then again probably not, as I assume a 2005 escape is front wheel drive?Yes, it is a front wheel drive.OK… You replaced your front motor mount… which basically keeps the engine from rising up and out of your hood or “doing a wheelie” lets say…  Which direction do you think it tries to twist when you do the opposite?  How bout the side and rear engine mounts?', 'I’d look into them in a serious manner.  It wouldn’t be the CV joints because they usually dont manifest that symptom.', 'You can also do this test for bad mounts.  Open your hood… Begin in park… Put in Drive and hold the brake and cycle the accelerator.  On and off the gas.  Watch engine.   After that go from Reverse to Drive and give it a little gas in each gear.  You may just recreate the actual sound…if so… you found another bad mount.', 'Let us know.I certainly will let you know. After posting this I recall reading that you should not see daylight through the rubber bushing of the mm. When I was under the car a few days ago doing something else, I gave the mounts a look at and noticed daylight through one of them. I thought at the time that it was by design. Then read that it is not a good sign.  I will have another look at them as soon as all the other things that are demanding my attention are satisfied.Kind of odd, because most things that would cause a clunk during acceleration (bad mounts) should cause a clunk when taking off from a stop as well. If it happens at a certain speed, maybe it’s making the noise when it’s in a certain gear, or downshifting to a certain gear.Dont forget and transmission mounts as well. I can speak from experience that you dont always get a thunk when accelerating but you can just feel it. If you have a whole set of bad mounts you should see a good deal of movement just from changing from park into gear. I dont know about the escape but look and see if it had a bobble strut, a small shock that dampens the engine movement, they go bad too.This is an update on the problem described in the first post of this thread. I finally got around to inspecting the motor mounts and none look obviously bad. I enlisted the help of a neighbor and had him put the trans in reverse and drive from neutral and rev the engine with all the brakes on while I observed the movement of the engine. it seemed to move a lot when revved and held so I decided to measure the movement. From the extreme of reverse to extreme of drive I measured 1 inch of up and down movement measuring from the valve cover on the front of the engine to the radiator bracket, which is very close. Not sure if this is too much movement or just right. But seeing as how the mounts have 165K on them, I’m thinking maybe I should just replace them all. This thunk is actually something that is more felt than heard.', 'JackOne inch doesn’t sound like it should be a problem but lay your hand on top of the engine and re-enlist you neighbor’s help.What does laying my hand on top of the engine supposed to tell me?Didn’t I read your post correctly?. I understood that you FELT the thud more than you heard it.Oh, I see, yes, felt more than heard. That thunk only happens when I am going above 35 mph or so and take my foot off the gas and then reapply the gas. Since I last posted I asked my neighbor to go through the same procedure. This time I watched the front and rear mounts. They both have rubber bushings inside a round steel casing with a single bolt passing through a steel bushing in the middle of the rubber and connecting to the engine/trans. I could see the rubber flex up and down on both front and back mounts as the engine was revved up in both drive and reverse, but more interesting is that I could see the portion of the frame that the front mount is bolted to move.  I will get under the vehicle tommorow to take a closer look.Other possibilities to consider', '', 'something in the trunk or under the seat is rolling around, check especially spare tire area, jack', 'suspension components are stressed during acceleration, so could be a strut, strut mount, ball joint, etc', 'exhaust components move during acceleration also, so check cat, muffler, pipe supports', '', 'My Corolla makes a similar noise at times, more often after removing my foot from the gas pedal to begin coasting to reduce speed,   and I think it is coming from the rear strut area.I have devised a theory as to what is happening. The rubber in the motor mounts is fatigued, allowing more movement than when new. When traveling at freeway speeds, and the accelerator pedal is allowed to return to its resting state, the braking action of the engine, even with an automatic transmission, causes it to be torqued in the opposite direction from when the engine is supplying power to the wheels. When the accelerator pedal is once again depressed, the torque on the engine is reversed, slamming it from one extreme to the other. This makes sense, and based on that I ordered the front and rear mounts and will install them this weekend. I already changed the right mount. I will change the left mount or not based on what results I get from changing the front and back ones.Your thought is pretty much right on point.', 'The only other thing is that since this car is new to you, there may well be something somewhere that is loose and banging around.  I’d check to see if the spare tire is secured well, and stick your head on the floor and look under the front seats with a flashlight.  I once bought a car that had a thunk and it turned out to be a golf ball that had ended up in the space between the rear fender in front of the rear wheel and the side of the floor of the trunk.I am convinced that this thunk is definitely coming from somewhere along the drivetrain. The fact that it occurs under very specific conditions, for me, rules out loose stuff knocking around. It only occurs when going fast, accelerator is released and then reapplied. The reapplication of the accelerator pedal does not need to be severe for the thunk to occur. In fact, there is no descernible acceleration when reapplying accelerator pedal, so no sudden jerking movement of vehicle surging forward. Since the transmission is in overdrive at this point I would have to jam the accelerator to get it to downshift and get a surge of acceleration. But this doesn’t happen at all. The reapplication of the accelerator produces only a very gentle re-engagenent of power to the wheels, but the thunk occurs, nonetheless… unless I am excurciatingly gentle when depressing the pedal. Then it does not occur. But the main thing is that there is no descernible acceleration when depressing the pedal normally. This, in my mind, is what makes the motor mounts suspect.', 'Having said that I am not ruling out some other explanation, but I am certain that it is somewhere along the drivetrain.The only other thought I have is some sort of looseness at the top of one of the front struts.  The forces of acceleration vs. coasting would have effects on all the front suspension, both twisting forces and shifting of load from rear to front.Thanks for the suggestion, wentwest. I will check out the front struts. Motor mounts due Friday and I hope to get them installed ASAP.  What I fear most is that this problem is caused by some condition in the transaxle.Welp, I changed the front and rear motor mounts, but still have the thunk. The rubber on the rear mount was completely separated from the metal casing on one side. The front one was cracked in several places but still one piece, so not a total waste of time and money. Still have the transmission mount to change, but doubt that is the problem. The top of the strut towers are both tight. Since it is not a severe problem I will put it on the back burner for a few days.', 'JackSooner or later you’re going to find this clunk, because it will either dawn on you at some random moment or it will get worse.  At least that’s how it works for me.']\n",

Same problems before and after the cable change.  So except for the fact that tightening the nut on the vertical bolt (nothing else moves)  always restored power until I finally broke the little bolt on the second clamp, my theory about the problem being bad design and quality of the clamp would certainly be refuted.

The fouling happens somewhat quickly. I’ll clean the plug or put a brand new one in and within a day or two it will be fouled again. None of the other plugs are fouling. Most of the oil appears on the threads but there is a small amount on the ground electrode. Generally this doesn’t cause too much drivability issues if the plug is removed and cleaned every few days but can feel a very small misfire under load if it goes too long without cleaning or replacing.', 'With a compression test done on the warm engine, the results showed 145 pounds in cylinder 4 which is a healthy amount. In fact it was even higher than the adjacent cylinder 5 plug pulled which was 140 or so. The car also doesn’t have blue smoke coming from the exhaust on startup or deceleration. So I’m pretty sure in conjunction, good compression and lack of exhaust smoke can eliminate the issue being bad valve stem seals or piston rings.', 'What’s more is that we did a smoke test by removing the cylinder 4 plug and blowing smoke in through the vacuum line and seeing if smoke would come out of cylinder 4 spark plug hole. No leaks - so this also eliminates a bad lower intake gasket. We also put a boroscope down cylinder 4 and there was no visible damage - and no oil inside the cylinder! This stumps me because the oil has to obviously be coming from somewhere…but there’s none in the cylinder!', 'The only obvious issue we saw was when doing the smoke test, a tiny amount of smoke was coming out near the pcv valve hose right where the PCV valve connects to the hose.

Also this engine doesn’t have spark plug tube seals so those aren’t a potential issue either.', 'Thoughts?Have you checked if the PCV valve is restricted?', 'TesterA 145 pounds of compression it NOT a healthy amount nor is 140.

      "['While driving at night with the low beam headlights on I noticed that the high beam indicator light was on, but very dimly lit. A few more night drives and the high beam indicator light would get a little brighter each time I would drive the car. Then both headlights stopped working simultaneously (no high beams either) and when I have the switch turned on for the low beam lights the high beam indicator light is fully illuminated. The side lights, turn signals, rear running lights, flashers and brake lights all work though. I’ve already replaced the headlight switch, tested the headlight relay and headlight fuse. So any idea what the problem could be?Sounds like a bad ground.Where’s the first place you’d check for a bad ground?There should be 3 wires going to each headlight socket,1 for high beam, 1 for low beam, and a ground wire. The ground is likely black with a stripe, but it could be some other color. Trace the ground back to where it attaches to the body.Is this the 1998 Mazda Protege that has all the rust . . . the one we advised you to get rid of quite some time ago?', 'If so, you may not be getting a ground through the rust . . . ?!', 'If that’s not you, my apologies', 'I’m bringing this up because you’ve obviously posted a few times before . . . and there are very few discussions concerning old Mazda ProtegesLOL. Yes, this is the car you’re talking about. But for being 22 years old and most of it’s life spent in a driveway/parking lot it’s really in pretty good shape. Not much rust at all.', 'So I went ahead and tried to trace the wires back but they run right into a hole in the body so I tried tugging on them to see if I could see where they come out but was unsuccessful. After that I decided to try the lights again thinking that maybe pulling on the wires improved the connection somehow and sure enough, the passenger side headlight came on. Both high and low beams. But here’s the thing; there was smoke coming from the plug (passenger’s side) that plugs into the bulb. There’s two red wires; one with a white stripe and the other with a black stripe. And then the third wire is black and the one that was getting so hot that it was melting/smoking the plastic plug. I looked closely and could see it’s metal plug was so far down on the bulb’s electrical connector that it was in contact with the little rounded tab thing at the base of the bulb. So I pulled the black wire’s plug back away from the base of the bulb and turned it back on and no more smoke. But the driver’s side headlight still doesn’t work at all. So If anyone understands what is going on here I’d greatly appreciate you filling me in. ThanksAfter looking closely at the bulb and applying common sense I don’t think the connector was too close to the base of the bulb. I’m now leaning towards the cause being corrosion of the black wire’s connector - creating high resistance/heat. I plan to clean up the connection and move the driver’s side bulb over to the passenger’s side to see if it is working and then go from there. Hopefully it’s blown but If it’s not… well, then I’ve got at least one other problem to deal with.You are correct in your thinking that the smoke was caused by a bad connection. Headlights require a significant amount of power to operate. Standard lights can require 55 watts of power. So even a small amount of resistance in the connection to the socket can cause heat to occur. You may have to replace the socket with a new one. I suspect the other light is out due to a ground problem also. You can supply your own ground from the light to the battery to prove it.', '', '', ' db4690:', '', 'Is this the 1998 Mazda Protege that has all the rust . . . the one we advised you to get rid of quite some time ago?', '', '', 'After giving this more thought.

The reason being is that each lamp had it’s own, independent ground problem. Based on that it seems very unlikely that they both went out a the same exact time.

It’s entirely possible, since they sit over all that heat and get brittle, are made of cheap crappy plastic ect, etc, etc, they could have easily have cracked it while working on it when changing your plugs. I only noticed it was cracked when I attempted to remove it to clean the upper intake. Had I not attempted to remove it, I might not have ever noticed and it still would have been stalling.', 'WayneCold temperatures make the engine – at idle –  more sensitive to the air/fuel mixture and to the amount the throttle valve is open. Those would be the place to start.  The throttle body check (make sure they check the throttle position sensor too)  mentioned above would address the latter, and for the former a shop would start by checking the ecm memory for active or pending diagnostic codes, and a general visual check for vacuum leaks.   If there’s any routine maintenance that’s behind schedule, sometimes getting all that up to date will fix a problem like this too.George may be spot on but the MAP sensor, if cracked, will literally suck air in if you lift the top of it and separate the crack. If you’re looking for things you can check yourself and don’t have lots of tools and all that, google where the sensor is and locate it, and just gently move it around. if it’s cracked and snaps off, at least you know what your problem was. if it’s solid and moving it doesn’t change the rpm’s it wasn’t that. If it’s a bad throttle position sensor, it’ll likely throw a code pretty specific to the throttle position sensor, unless it’s just cracked and sucking air in. You may be looking at a vacuum leak and, after getting the motor cover off, will start it up and say, “hey, that’s sucking air right there…let’s find out what that part is…” If you don’t find it by “nosing” around under there, by all means take it in. These forums aren’t very good for telling people what to tell the mechanic to do, they’re good for telling people willing to get their hands greasy what to look for. A decent mechanic already knows what to look for and how to look for it. As a mechanic, my worst enemy is the internet. Customers that don’t know how to put air in their tire suddenly know “exactly how it’s done” and “exactly how much it’s supposed to cost” will literally get indignant with you if it wasn’t the same as what they googled. It’s not a bad thing to learn about stuff even if you’re not going to do it yourself but the situation I’m talking about will often result in you paying more.

This was actually a very good thing for an engine.', 'Nowadays, with the advent of catalytic converters, it is possible to damage the converter if too much oil is being burned–either as a Top Oil, or a 2 cycle gas & oil mixture, or as a result of badly  worn piston rings.   However, an occasional instance of dumping that 2 cycle gas/oil mixture into a relatively full gas tank will not damage the CC, and may provide some nice extra lubrication for the upper cylinder area.', 'The only caveat would be if this gas/oil mixture is more than…let’s say…6 months old.  In that case, the gas could be “sour”, and you could wind up with deposits in the fuel system.', 'As long as this gas/oil mixture is not more than 6 months old, this gallon of 2 cycle gas/oil mix should do no damage  to the engine or CC, and may actually be good for your engine.You might try putting a cup or two in there at first and see what it does, rather than dump the whole thing in there. If nothing happens, put a little bit more in at your next fill up.No problem, not enough 2 cycle oil in there to hurt anything.Your gas:oil mixture is probably about 32:1.  If you add the mixed gallon of mower fuel to 10 gallons of gas in you car’s tank, the mix ratio is now one-third of one percent - just about nothing.  I wouldn’t worry about it as long as you put the gallon into a nearly full tank of gas.I agree. I’ve been doing it for years and unless the motors self destructed on the cars of subsequent owners, I’ve experienced no problems. With two stroke, you can add a little stabile and keep over the winter and use the next year if it’s a yearly thing. Personally, i feel stabil is unnecessary for winter storage, but do it as a safety precaution. Lastly, if you don’t trust what we say, just dispose of it legally.If it is gasoline for a weed wacker and 60 to 1 mix, you have even more reason to just pour it in. That is close to nothing for a mix. The other mix is just two times nothing and your car would probably run on a whole tank full of the stuff and not ever notice it.Find a friend with a Dodge or Chrysler minivan, pour it in the tank, and nobody will notice the smoke since the minivans do that all the time.Uncle Turbo, 5 Stars, best adviceThere’s not enough oil in that mix to cause any damage to your car, especially if you are diluting it further with a full tank of gas.  If you still have reservations about burning it in your car, take the stuff to a place with an oil-fired heater and pour it in their waste oil tank (with their permission, of course).  One of those can certainly burn that stuff, and the people who own them are usually happy to have the free heat.  Just don’t pour antifreeze in there.  They usually don’t appreciate it.They don’t appreciate GASOLINE in there either!!  Please don’t post things you know nothing about…Gasoline in a waste oil burner ? Now there is one a scary thought.

Anyone know if there’s any way out of this without a couple hundred dollars in repairs 10 days before Christmas?Are you certain you didn’t just blow the fuse? Usually that happens long before the motor manages to destroy anything.More than likely a ball and socket joint in the linkage popped out or where the motor connects to the linage popped out.

You may have to remove the cowling under the windshield to find the problem but that isn’t a difficult task really.  Of course it is possible that you actually did some damage, but more often than not something just broke loose.Try removing the wiper arms and inspect the splines of the arms where they mount to the posts. The arms are made from aluminum. And when wipers freeze to the windshield and are then turned on, the splines in the arms usually get stripped out so the wipers don’t function. If the splines are stripped out of the wiper arms it’s just a matter of replacing the wiper arms.', 'TesterThat was my first guess, but you can hear the motor whirring when you switch the wipers on, and its speed changes depending on the switch setting, as expected.Thanks, I’ll try this!I haven’t tried, yet - mostly because we have no garage and it’s single-digits outside, and snowing.

He said the most he could get out of a set of tires in that size was 10,000 miles, and those were so hard he couldn’t get traction in the rain.  He was in the shop at least every month having brake and suspension parts replaced, including pads and rotors, tie rod ends, ball joints, sway bar links, bushings, etc.  This was bad for us, too, because those wheels and tires probably weighed 130-140 pounds each!

There are many examples where forensics have been used to track down a vehicle with the smallest shred of evidence left behind. It comes down to desire and $$$.

But really, who would go to such extremes for a mailbox? No authoritative body is going to launch an investigation over a damaged mailbox.Are you sure this is a serial number?

Thanks again.Unfortunately, I didn’t find it so I can’t tell you how difficult it would be to find. I had my mechanic look into the problem, he saw a spark, and was able to easily see the worn insulation. The spark helped focus the search. It was on an exposed portion of the wiring that was touching another piece in the engine compartment that vibrated. I guess 20 years of the minute amount of rubbing simply wore the insulation off.', 'If it was me looking for such a thing, I would open the hood with the engine off and note where wiring is not protected by any covering or harness or that might have greater exposure to heat. I would then turn on the engine and note what portions may be subject to rubbing or vibration; if you have lived a good and pure life, you may get lucky and see a spark! I’d then turn off the engine and inspect the wiring in those locations. If it has been sparking, you may see discolored/burnt spots. I’d also try to get a wiring diagram, find the wiring for the possible causes and inspect the individual wires.', 'If you don’t find anything, at least you have done your best to find a simple and less expensive cause. I know I’d feel lousy if I threw a couple hundred dollars of parts at a fix only to find that it was something I could have found had I inspected it.Sometimes you can even HEAR the spark, as it escapes past the bad insulation and finds a path to ground', 'Kind of sounds like somebody clicking a ball point pen', 'It also helps if it’s dark outside.  Sometimes that makes it easier to see misfires due to bad plug wiresHave you checked fuel pressure?  A weak fuel pump can run, but not deliver optimal fuel pressure.  I wouldn’t replace a fuel pump without checking pressure first.', 'Along those lines, when was the fuel filter last replaced?My guess is the same as Mustang’s, faulty ignition module. But it’s just a guess.  Could be the fuel pump or the crank position sensor among other things.  If you can get it to stall and not start, that would be a good time to check for spark at a spark plug during cranking. If you do that and find the spark is ok but it still won’t start, ask your shop if they can fix you up with a fuel pressure gauge located where you can see it as you drive.  Next time this happens look at the gauge. If it is registering close to zero, you know you have a fuel pressure problem. That doesn’t 100% mean the problem is the pump — the pump won’t work if the ECM thinks the engine isn’t turning – but the guess at that point would still be the pump.When I was trying to figure out my stalling problems, I got a coil with the ignition module from a junk yard for about $25.  Should be no problem getting a used one to try.  That wasn’t it for me but was a cheap try.Hi all- this is way late but I thought I would post the fix- it was the crankshaft pos sensor. For some reason when I checked for codes at autozone (twice) I saw nothing, but once I brought it to a shop they saw it was throwing the CPS code. He put a new one in and problem was solved.Pickup coil under distributor. Mark the firewall with where the rotor points, so you can get as close as possible with the next one.

That’s not a way to prevent oil consumption.One quart every 5k miles is nothing to worry about in my book. It is unfortunate there is no dipstick, I would not loose too much sleep over it. My big question would be how low is it when the warning kicks in. If it comes on when you are at 2 quarts instead of 5 and you add one quart that is not good.

Question is did I do potential damage to my car and what should I be on the alert for?Very obviously, you were not in neutral, because a car in neutral won’t move.  It sounds like you were in first gear, and the transmission was not shifting up to second.  Read your owner’s manual about the operation choices you can make as the operator that might have led to the non-shifting.  Also, look carefully to see if the indicator for your gear shift is giving the appearance of being in neutral when it isn’t.  So, the question is…how many different positions of the gear shift will allow the car to move forward…and what is each position used for?  That is why I suggest reading the manual.,and I doubt if you did any damage.  You were just hearing the engine at high RPM, and the engine probably has a mechanism to limit the RPM  to prevent engine damage.Driving in neutral is also known as “coasting.” You might maintain 30mph for 2 miles going downhill but not on level pavement. I’m inclined to more-or-less agree with @oldnotdeadyet that you were probably just in a lower gear than usual. There was likely no harm done. Assuming it’s an automatic, your Mazda 3 has a 4 speed transmission. It could have been in second gear. There could be a problem with the linkage between the shift lever and the transmission. A good independent transmission shop can tell you more.']\n",

What’s causing the blower motor switch to burn out so often? I notice the dial to adjust the vent air from hot to cold feels burning hot if that’s any help.

Just went back out and was able to shift my caliper by hand with ease so that’s clearly the issue.  Going to go grab a bolt after work and save myself $400.A seized caliper could be hot enough to melt a hubcap.If this is the case,you will need a new caliper.You could buy a remanufactured caliper at 1/3 the price of  the OEM in most autoparts store.I am having a similar problem with the passenger side of my FWD 2003 Impala. I took off the caliper to clean and grease the pins and once I put it back on, the driver side wheel started locking up while the passenger wheel wouldn’t spin. I’ve never seen this in my life. I’ve been having transmission problems before hand but for some reason only one of the front tires will spin at a timeSo are all the caliper bolts in place? That was the problem with both the original lost and one 4 years later.Yes all of them are. I took them out, cleaned them and greased then before putting them back in.']\n",

      "['102000miles on my 2012 Subaru Legacy. Tooling down the interstate, the car starts shaking, and all the dash lights come on. Got it towed to a repair shop (reputable) and was told it would cost between 3500-4000 to repair it. A bad valve was causing compression issues. Car, in good shape, only valued at 5500 retail. Why fix it? Now, what do I do with the car?How do they know it’s a bad valve?They put it on a computer and that apparently was what the error code read. That’s what I was told anyway.Which engine does the car have?2.5i four cylinderWith very little info to go on, I will make an assumption here based on the complaint, bad valve, and compression issue.', 'The assumption would be valve lash has tightened and burned one or more exhaust valves. Yes, I know Subaru and other car makers only recommend a valve lash check (and a totally bogus audible one at that) every millennium or so but that recomendation is pure garbage.', 'Valve lash should be checked every 30k miles. Failure to do so leaves the car owner at risk for valve/cylinder head damage. In your case it’s likely that valve lash was tightening up over time and during the interstate tooling the tipping point arrived.', 'The price for what I assume (again, a dreaded assumption) is burned valve damage seems a bit high to me. You might price this job around and if possible you might clarify exactly what was said to you so the word assume and its various forms could be dropped from the discussion.Thanks for the help. The Subaru dealer called me and said the repair would be between $4000-$5200, more than the car’s value. I bought the Subaru because they were supposed to be good cars. Mine only had 102,000 miles on it.Remember that the Subaru dealership is motivated to sell you a new Subaru. Also remember that dealerships usually cost more (often a lot more) than independent shops. And finally, remember that the guy you talked to was probably not a mechanic, but a service advisor, which is dealership speak for “salesgoober who may or may not know anything about cars.”This is a headgaskets repair in disguise. No worries. Take it to a non dealer shop, pulll the heads, replace 1 or both. It’s not 4000$You can have it towed to the junkyardYou have received good advice above.  First of all, it is very common for these type of engines to need new head gaskets at around this mileage, and the cost to replace one head with rebuilt doesn’t double the price of the job.', 'Second, you should be able to have this work done for less than $3k.  It is not necessary to have this repair done at a dealer, and in fact would be better to have it done at an independent shop which will use better-quality aftermarket parts.  Dealers generally use nothing but genuine OEM parts, which are sometimes the best, but not always.  Their labor rates are often higher than other shops, as well.', 'Third, and most importantly, one should not fall into the trap of comparing repair costs to book value.  What is important is not how much it costs to repair your car versus what you could sell this car for on the open market.  What is important is how much the repair costs are versus the alternative (which for most people would be junking the car and buying a different new or used car).  Unless the car has other issues, such as body damage, rust, salvage title, etc, it makes sense to do the repairs.What @bcohen2010 wrote is the correct view.  The value of the car is its value TO YOU, not its retail value.  Which would you rather own, your current car, repaired at a shop that specializes in Subarus (not a dealer that specializes in selling new cars) or another used car that you can buy for the same money as the cost of repair?ok4450, I have a question. I was surprised the Subaru did not have hydraulic lifters.  Don’t most other cars?', 'Mechanical valves and 100,000 mile head gaskets makes me a “never Subaru”.@oldnotdeadyet. Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, some of us had the opposite viewpoint.  We thought solid lifters were better.  In his book, “What You Should Know About Cars”, Tom Mccahill thought a properly adjusted valve with solid lifters was quieter than a valve with hydraulic lifters.  He argued that hydraulic lifters required the use of detergent oil which he didn’t like. Mccahill said that he preferred to have detergent in his bathtub, but not in his engine.  He argued that the detergent held particles in suspension and they were whipped through the engine bearings instead of settling to.the bottom of the oil pan.Dis the Subaru dealer actually analyze the vehicle or only take the word of the shop?  You need a second opinion and that must be done in the shop, so this means another tow.', 'The computer code will not identify a bad valve.  It can identify a mis-firing cylinder and that is about it.  It takes more in-depth trouble shooting to find the exact cause of the problem.  For what is at stake here, I would have it towed to the dealer and pay for an in-depth diagnosis, including a compression test, a cylinder pressure test with sound monitoring at both the intake and exhaust for an air leak and a cooling system pressure test.', 'It is quite possible that you only need head gaskets.  Also, did anyone check the coolant level after the incident?  Low coolant would be a big clue that it is the head gasket.Subaru has used hydraulic lifters a few times over the years but for the most part it’s been solid lifters.', 'Needing a valve adjustment and not having it done which leads to a burned valve issue does not make the car a bad one. Valve lash is a maintenance item which should be performed every 30k miles IMO.', 'Consumers can be given a pass because their owners manuals (and this includes other makes also) may recommend a 100k, 120k miles lash inspections. That is done for one reason; to make your car appear to need less maintenance than it really does. And service advisors who know little only recite the corporate line.', 'On top of that idiocy, they also recommend an “audible” lash inspection which just compounds the idiocy factor. There is no way on God’s Green Earth that a mechanic can listen to an engine and determine what the valve lash is. I’ve been dealing with solid lifters for approx. 50 years and there’s no way I can tell what they are doing with my ears. If one is excessively loose it can be detected audibly but how does one know that a quiet lifter  which is about to burn a valve exists? No one can.', 'I still think this repair (even if both cylinder heads are needed) can be done for far less than the given estimate. In most cases the heads can be reworked with a few valve seat replacements and a full valve job. They have to be pretty bad to reach junk status.Thanks ok4450I have had it towed to a Subaru dealer. They have not run any tests on it yet. The shop that AAA took it to are the ones that said what it was, and that they couldn’t repair it as it needed special tools. They are a reputable shop, but I will wait to hear from the dealer. Thanks for the input.I’m going to wait and get a final analysis from the dealer. The original shop it was taken to has a very good reputation both for doing good repairs, and for their pricing. So if they say they can’t repair it, I believe them. I, of course, did not want to take it to a Subaru dealer, but it was a last resort. The other concern I have is, if the repair is equal to the value of the car, and I get it fixed, I will be married to that car forever if other things go wrong.I think I would have it repaired because it should sell or trade for at least enough to cover the repair costs. I might even drive it for a while and decide if I wanted to keep it.  It has very little value now.']\n",

      "['Today’s repeat of the fuel tank problem had an incorrect answer.  The 1/4 line is NOT at the center of mass of the semicircular pizza cardboard. The calculus boys can prove that. The basic issue is that the 1/4 line depends only upon mass, and the balance point depends on both the mass and the distance (distribution) of the mass. Just like an adult and a kid on a teeter-totter, there is a balance point even when the masses are not equal. Click and Clack should never listen to an anonymous physicist!oldnotdead is correct. The balance point does not mean equal mass on both sides, but equal MOMENT (mass times distance). To use the pizza circle trick, he should have sliced thin sections parallel to the table until the weight of the sections on both sides were the same.Click and Clack SHOULD listen to anonymous engineers!The answer was wrong. It’s easier to calculate that the center of mass is not the correct spot if you make the the tank diamond shaped with a distance 1 to each corner from the center. The 1/4 area point is a distance 1/sqrt(2) up from the bottom point. The center of mass of the triangular bottom half of the diamond is a distance 2/3 up from the bottom.If we are going to morph the tank, I’ll morph it into two identical rectangles placed into a TEE shape. Then the center-of-mass of each rectangle is obvious, and it clear that they are different distances from the intersection line of the two. For a rectangle of size LxW, one moment arm is L/2 and the other is W/2. This “proves” that the line of equal masses is not the balance point. There is nothing “special” about a circle that changes this principle for the fuel tank.I was wondering about this answer and didn’t get a chance to look at it until now. This center of mass idea would yield a top ?half? of the half-tank that was nearly 10% larger than the bottom. If the tank were diamond-shaped, as Dekabg suggested, the top portion would be 25% larger.', 'You?d think that Click and Clack would have an assistant on the show that could check these puzzlers and answers for accuracy.', 'Congratulations Denise from Hawaii for correctly guessing the incorrect puzzler answer.Yep, it’s an obvious, but wrong, answer to the problem', 'just as you say.', 'A hypothetical mismatched pair of brothers on the playground,', \"(call 'em Maximus Tappet and Minimus Tappet) would have\", 'first found out this principle on some Boston area see-saw.', 'They had to discover the distance-from-pivot rule in order', 'to properly balance.', 'I guess they’ve forgotten the playground wisdom of', 'their long-departed youth.Again, your’re over-analyzing the problem.  The solution assumes uniform density of the fuel.  If the density of the mass resting on a lever such as a teeter-toter was uniform, then it would balance.  If a fat kid on one side was to spread his mass over his entire side of the lever and a child of lesser mass did the same on the opposite side, the teeter-toter would fall in favor of the fat kid every time.  Think of the fuel in the tank as a mass resting on the fulcrum that is equal at every point.  The cardboard “slice” is a brilliant example of using assumptions to simplify a problem.The true way to avoid over-analysis is to check every idea by experiment.  If you are one of those who believe the balance point is the right answer, I have two suggestions:', '', 'Find the balance point of the semicircle pizza board, and cut the board into two pieces along this line. Then weigh each piece and you will find they are not identical.', 'If you don’t have scales this sensitive, tape a coarse graph paper over each portion, and count the squares.

The 1/4 line is not the balance point.Again, your're over-analyzing the problem...You're under-analyzing it, and not understanding the problem, or the answer.Oldnotdead suggested an experiment to prove this. While I’m not going to take the time to try to cut out some cardboard and balance things, etc. Here is a graphical representation of the problem that I posted in the other thread on this matter. I created a semicircle in AutoCad the same dimensions required by the problem. I let the program tell me where the centroid, or center of mass, was. I then created two regions based on that centroid. They are most definitely not the same area, which would equate to mass in a uniformly dense material, of course. I also created a diamond-shaped tank (as suggested earlier) with corners 10 inches from center. Indeed the difference becomes even more apparent in that shape.Great drawings, jt1979. Now can you show the location of the COM of the TEE that I suggested above?  That shape shows the equal masses clearly, and the fact the COM is not at the “expected” location.And, for those who don’t have a scales, but like “balance”:  take the two pieces, and tie thread to them and hang them from each end of a ruler. That is, use the ruler as a balance to see which piece weighs more.Oldnothead, it sounded like this is what you were talking about.LMAO, I just realized I wrote “old-not-head” instead of “old-not-dead” in that response. A simple typing error, I assure you; not trying to call you a knot head!The only thing I would add is the measurement showing the balance point.  However, given the data you do show, I can see that it is 8.50.\", 'So the COM is at 8.50 and the “1/4 line” is at 10.00. Of course, they are different numbers for every different tank shape. I don’t think you have given these two numbers for the cylindrical tank.I’m slowly approaching the “oldknothead” time of life.“oldnotdead” is definitely correct.  As Tom and Ray mentioned the week after the original call, the integral calculus is a little ugly, so I just created a simple Excel sheet (attached) and divided up the lower half of the tank into 1000 slices.  Imagine each slice as adding a teaspoon of fuel to the tank.  Actually, we’re filling it from the mid-point down to the bottom instead of bottom-up, but mathematically it’s all the same.', 'I can explain the various columns in detail if anyone’s interested, but the bottom line is this: Counting up the area alone, the 1/4 mark is at 0.404Radius (0.202Diameter) below the center of the tank.  Using the center of mass approach, you get 0.424Radius (0.212Diameter), which is a 5% error.  Pretty close, but definitely wrong.', 'The reason that it’s as close as it is is because the half circle is sort-of close to a rectangular shape, not super-imbalanced top-to-bottom.  As some of the other posters have noted, as the shape gets more and more imbalanced (e.g. triangle, T shape), the error becomes larger and larger.Fascinating analysis!  I too had jumped to the conclusion that balancing a cardboard cut-out supplied the correct answer.', 'But I also got hung up on an earlier step in the solution.  In their answer, Tom & Ray said “Using 10th grade geometry, he drew two chords on the circular piece of cardboard to find the center of the circle.”  It sounds like they’re talking about this technique:', 'http://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter.html 1', 'But that requires improvising something that you can use as a compass.  There’s a better way, using only the right-angle corners of the pizza box:', \"http://www.mathopenref.com/constcirclecenter2.html 1I don't think you have given these two numbers for the cylindrical tank.The center of mass on the cylindrical tank is shown in my first drawing to be at 5.7359 inches above the bottom.

I Bought 4 for a 99 Camry 3 of them did not have the bearing/mount on correctly, resulting in lots of noise while driving. I somewhat blame myself for not checking them well, just a quick visual. So basically had to remove them re-do the bearing attachment and re-install. Some lessons are learned the hard way.If you can go with Bilstein that will be your best bet in my opinion. They will outperform and handle way better than stock and give you a smoother ride at the same time on most vehicles. My second choice would be KYB. Summitracing.com 20 normally has both those brands in stock for the lowest price most of the time. Sometimes you can find a set of all four on eBay for a little bit less. If you can get a kit with new springs and strut mounts they cost a little bit more but they make it very easy to install. I like both those brands because they make the vehicle feel more planted while giving you better performance and handling at the same time with a smoother ride. On top of not having to adjust them to get the stiffness you want. Gabriel and Monroe seem to be OEM quality or less most of the time. They might come with a lifetime warranty, but Bilstein and KYB I think will last longer in most cases.An old thread but if its a DIY project and if a complete EZ strut kit is available, I’d make that the priority over the brand.', 'The alternative is using a spring compressor, which isn’t too difficult but more dangerous if something fails or slips.']\n",

The post had been up for 8 months already, so I’m not going to be offering the full $1200 he’s asking for it. It hasn’t been registered in 4 years, it needs a battery, the drivers window, and the new muffler welded on. The ad says he got it as a hunting rig, did some work to it, like spark plugs, thermostat, etc, and it runs great but he doesn’t have time to fix it and just wants to get rid of it. I plan to use my toyota corolla battery to start and test drive it because the amperage (CCA) is about the same as most batteries for the cherokee. He said I can drive it around the property to test that the 4x4 works, but theres not enough room to get up to speed to make sure that the transmision goes through all gears and there’s no death wobble. I’m curious if these '91 XJ cherokees are known for automatic transmission failures, and if there is anything else I should watch out for besides electrical issues. It only has 125,000 miles, and the interior looks great, but the outside is faded and missing both bumpers. The front bumper seems to have been replaced by two beams welded to the frame and sticking out like a weapon.

In ~ 7 decades I’ve experienced this once (it also happened to a friend’s son who related it on “Car Talk”) and I have no interest in a repeat.   If you really feel compelled to make the final connection at the battery, first remove the vents, fan away fumes for a minute or so, and cover the top of the battery closely with a wet rag (to serve as a flame arrestor) before making the last connection.

A battery that needs a jump isn’t outgassing at the moment the cable is attached to the negative post. Is it because there’s a spark when you disconnect?Jumpstarting instructions are long and complicated and seem overly cautious, and what Ken said is what everyone with a cold winter needs to pay attention to: If it’s below freezing and your battery’s been dead overnight, the electrolyte might be frozen so when you jump it the battery explodes.', 'In warm weather there’s very little risk in jumpstarting.Couple of reasons.

I haven’t owned a car with a manual transmission in years but I’m not sure what the white lube might be for. You shouldn’t be able to see actual gear oil, that’s in the transmission.

A spacer or travel extender I think it was called… was put in.So you think I’m looking at the clutch going bad?Yes, probably a bad clutch.
